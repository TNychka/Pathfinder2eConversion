The Tairnadal priests are known as the Keepers of the Past, and their ranks include both clerics and bards. At birth (or upon joining the Tairnadal, in the case of a half-elf or Aereni recruit) the Keepers of the Past consult the spirits to determine an elf’s patron ancestor. The Tairnadal believe that by emulating the behavior of their patron ancestors, they give those ancestors a chance to live again in the current generation.</span></p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div>\n<div class=\"bg-paper page d-flex flex-wrap\" data-markdown=\"1\">\n<div class=\"flex-even column\" data-markdown=\"1\">\n<div class=\"content\" data-markdown=\"1\">\n<p><strong>Areas of Concern</strong> Glory, battle, bravery, honour<br /><strong>Alignment</strong> N<br /><strong>Divine Font</strong> Heal or Harm<br /><strong>Divine Ability</strong> Strength or Constitution<br /><strong>Divine Skill</strong> Athletics<br /><strong>Domains</strong> Confidence, Destruction, Might, Protection, Zeal<br /><strong>Cleric Spells</strong> 1st: true strike, 2nd: enlarge, 4th: weapon storm<br /><strong>Edicts</strong> Strive to uphold the ideals of your ancestor spirit, practice with a weapon every day, destroy the negative undead.<br /><strong>Anathema</strong> Become or create undead, fail to strive to uphold your ancestor spirit, dishonour yourself, parlay with oathbreakers.<br /><strong>Favoured Weapon</strong> Double Scimitar</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>"},"source":{"value":"Pathfinder's Guide to Eberron"},"category":"deity","alignment":{"own":"N","follower":["LG","NG","CG","LN","N","CN","LE","NE","CE"]},"domains":{"primary":["confidence","might","zeal","protection"],"alternate":[]},"font":["harm","heal"],"ability":["con","str"],"skill":"ath","weapons":["scimitar"],"spells":{"1":"Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Gb7SeieEvd0pL2Eh","2":"Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.wzctak6BxOW8xvFV","4":"Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.8M03UxGXjYyDFAoy"},"rules":[],"slug":null,"schema":{"version":0.812,"lastMigration":{"datetime":"2023-01-05T15:11:50.170-08:00","version":{"schema":0.743,"foundry":"10.291","system":"4.6.3"}}}},"ownership":{"default":0,"gpqVTtIbNz8RoupR":3},"_stats":{"systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"4.6.3","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1672960310200,"modifiedTime":1672960365847,"lastModifiedBy":"lxzmymmFddOcN8CB"}}
