When you are adjacent to at least one ally, you and adjacent allies gain a +1 circumstance bonus to AC and saving throws. This bonus increases to +2 to Reflex saves against area effects.</p>\n<p class=\"hang\"><strong>Olarune</strong> You no longer need to take cover to gain the higher bonus from tower shields, instead, you always have the higher bonus. In addition, with your great strength, you can wield tower shields beyond what any other mortal could carry. Anyone may craft tower shields out of any precious material, but only you may wield them due to their great bulk. When crafting a tower shield out of a precious material that is not darkwood, you must have the equivalent value in darkwood (up to the maximum price of the shield). For instance, crafting a standard-grade adamantine tower shield is a total cost of 440 GP with at least 55 GP of adamantine and 55 GP of darkwood.</p>\n<p class=\"hang\"><strong>Rhaan</strong> The tricks of the fey have become part of your repertoire. You can cast haste and slow as primal innate spells once per day. At 17th level, these are heightened to 7th level.</p>\n<p class=\"hang\"><strong>Sypheros</strong> The realm of the dead grants you a pathway to many abilities some consider to be unnatural. You can save others from death, and also yourself. The DC of your recovery checks is to 8 + your dying value, or 7 + your dying value if you have the Toughness general feat. In addition, once per day you can cast death ward as an occult innate spell.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"flex-even column\" data-markdown=\"1\">\n<div class=\"item d-flex flex-wrap\" data-markdown=\"1\">\n<div class=\"flex-even column\" data-markdown=\"1\">\n<p class=\"hang\"><strong>Therendor</strong> Your healing abilities channelled by the power of the moon can bring back those others could not. If a creature has died of mortal wounds within the last minute, you may attempt an Administer First Aid check. On a critical success, the creature is revived, loses the dying condition (but remains unconscious), and becomes drained 1 for 1 week. This check can not overcome extraordinary circumstances, such as diseases, curses, or massive damage to the body. After you attempt this special check, the creature becomes immune to it for a week.</p>\n<p class=\"hang\"><strong>Vult</strong> You can ward off even the eyes that would follow your movements.

You can create intricate patterns and even images on your skin, and shift them about in mesmerizing ways. You can achieve effects such as lighting coursing up your arms, or and fire dancing in a crown around your brow. You gain the @Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.TnF9hfOywfD8cE2v]{Virtuosic Performer (Dance)} (if you already have the Virtuosic Performer in dance, you may choose an additional different speciality). When you use the Virtuosic Performer feat for dance, you gain a +1 status bonus if you augment your performance with a special use of shift shape, or +2 if you are Legendary in Performance. This use of shift shape is free as part of the performance and lasts until you shift shape again.</p>\n<p><strong style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">Special</strong><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\"> Skin dancer counts for the favourable form of the Personable Performer feat as well.</span></p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>"},"source":{"value":"Pathfinder's Guide to Eberron"},"traits":{"value":["hb_eberron-changelings"],"rarity":"common","custom":""},"rules":[],"slug":null,"schema":{"version":0.812,"lastMigration":{"datetime":"2023-01-05T15:12:02.648-08:00","version":{"schema":0.73,"foundry":"10.291","system":"4.6.3"}}},"level":{"value":9},"featType":{"value":"ancestry"},"onlyLevel1":false,"maxTakable":1,"actionType":{"value":"passive"},"actions":{"value":null},"prerequisites":{"value":[{"value":"Expert in Performance."}]},"location":null},"ownership":{"default":0,"gpqVTtIbNz8RoupR":3},"_stats":{"systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"4.6.3","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1672960323119,"modifiedTime":1672974935794,"lastModifiedBy":"lxzmymmFddOcN8CB"}}
