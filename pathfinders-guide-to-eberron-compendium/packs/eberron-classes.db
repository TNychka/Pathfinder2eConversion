The soldiers of the united kingdom relied on sword and bow. But as the Last War began, Aundair took stock of its resources. Thanks to the presence of the Arcane Congress, Aundair led Galifar in mystical education. Assembling the first regiment of arcane dragoons, Aundair developed the war staff and battle rod. Over the course of the Last War, these techniques spread across the Five Nations and beyond. Today it’s no surprise to see a tough inquisitive or a Sentinel Marshal with a sword in one hand and a wand in the other. But no one calls these people “arcane dragoons.” If you fight your battles with fire bolt or sacred flame, you’re known as a “wandslinger.” EE 26<br />Wielding wands alongside weapons, wandslingers are masters of a new form of martial art - wandslinging. Wandslinging is the art of blending arcane spell duelling with martial combat efficiency, enabling wandslingers to perform feats of combat prowess that neither wizard nor fighter could. Though they cast spells, they do so through the use of widespread items - wands and staves - rather than by arcane incantation. The flexibility to perform in many roles, along with their tenacity, grit, and martial expertise, has begun to develop the wandslingers notable reputation throughout Khorvaire.</p>\n<h2>Way of the Wandslinger (1st)</h2>\n<p>You've learned the intricacies of magic and wands, blending the two with deadly results. You combine a working knowledge of arcane theories with a strong connection to improvised wands that allows you to manifest spells in battle alongside your martial combat.

You gain the Cast a Spell activity, and can cast arcane spells. Each time you gain a spell slot of a new level from the wandslinger archetype, add a spell of that level or lower to your spellbook. However - unlike a normal spellcaster - you can only use the @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.aBQ8ajvEBByv45yz]{Cast a Spell} activity Activating by an item. You gain a special spellbook with wand incantations for four common arcane cantrips of your choice. During your daily preparations, you create two unique cantrip wands each capable of casting one of these cantrips. These cantrip wands have no limit to their use and are never at risk of overcharge.</p>\n<p>Any wand or stave that you use is considered an advanced martial firearm, and loaded while it still has a least one charge or daily use remaining. The use of these wands or staves still requires the Cast a Spell activity rather than a Strike action, and may not be used as a replacement for Strikes as a result. You do not become trained in spell attack rolls or spell DCs from this source. Instead, when casting from any wand or stave, use your advanced firearm proficiency for the spell attack roll and gunslinger class DC for DCs. Your key spellcasting ability for wandslinger archetype spells is Intelligence, and they are arcane gunslinger spells.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div>\n<div class=\"bg-paper page d-flex flex-wrap\" data-markdown=\"1\">\n<div class=\"flex-even column\" data-markdown=\"1\">\n<div class=\"item d-flex flex-wrap\" data-markdown=\"1\">\n<div class=\"flex-even column\" data-markdown=\"1\">\n<p>During your daily preparations, you can prepare a staff as a prepared spellcaster.
