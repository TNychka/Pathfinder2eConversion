You Cast a Spell from a wand or stave that takes 1, 2, or 3 actions and requires a spell attack roll. Reduce the number of actions required by 1 (minimum 0). The effects of the spell don't occur immediately but are imbued into your wand or stave instead. Until the item is used, it is considered a loaded advanced firearm. When you make a ranged firearm strike using the item, you discharge the effects of the spell. If the effect is not used before the start of your next turn, the effect is lost.</p>\n<hr />\n<div class=\"flex-even column\" data-markdown=\"1\">\n<div class=\"note d-flex flex-wrap\" data-markdown=\"1\">\n<div class=\"flex-even column\" data-markdown=\"1\">\n<h1>Spellfire Specifics</h1>\n<p>Spellfire allows you to use wands as firearms, using spells as bullets. After spending the first actions to cast the spell, the effects occur when the Strike action is used to discharge the spell like a fired bullet.<br />For instance, you could use Spellfire to imbue your wand with Ray of Frost by spending 1 action, then make a regular strike or use an ability such as Blast Lock, Called Shot, Cauterize, Cover Fire, Paired Shots, Penetrating Fire, or Ricochet Shot where Ray of Frost replaces one of the strikes.</p>\n<p class=\"hang\"><strong>Targeting:</strong> The spell targets only one target of your Strike, even if it normally allows more targets. If your Strike targets more than one target such as with Bullet Split or Penetrating Fire, only one target takes the effects of the spell and the additional targets instead take the take force damage equal to your spellcasting modifier.</p>\n<p class=\"hang\"><strong>Misfire:</strong> If your wand would \"misfire\" as a result of the ability you used, you instead take force damage equal to your level.</p>\n<p class=\"hang\"><strong>Ancillary Effects:</strong> Your spell still has any non-targeted effects that might affect creatures other than the target, as well as any ongoing effects starting from the moment you hit with the Strike. For example, acid splash would still deal its splash damage to creatures other than the target and tanglefoot's circumstance penalty would last for its normal duration. The spell takes effect after the Strike deals damage; if the Strike has other special effects, the GM determines whether they happen before or after the spell.</p>\n<p class=\"hang\"><strong>Multiple Defenses:</strong> Any additional rolls after the initial spell attack still happen normally, such as the Fortitude save attempted by the target of a disintegrate spell. Similarly, a spell that allows you to attack with it again on subsequent rounds can only replace a Strike with its initial attack roll, not with any later ones.</p>\n<p class=\"hang\"><strong>Variable Actions:</strong> Some spells have different effects based on the number of actions you spend to cast them. You choose whether to use the effects of the 1-action, 2-action, or 3-action version of the spell when you use Spellfire. A spell has to take exactly 1, 2, or 3 actions; you can't use Spellfire with a spell that takes a free action, reaction, or 4 or more actions.</p>\n<p class=\"hang\"><strong>Metamagic:</strong> You typically can't use metamagic with Spellfire because metamagic requires the next action you take to be Cast a Spell, and Spellfire is a combined activity that doesn't qualify.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>"},"source":{"value":"Pathfinder's Guide to Eberron"},"traits":{"value":["hb_wandslinger"],"rarity":"common","custom":""},"rules":[],"slug":"spellfire","schema":{"version":0.812,"lastMigration":{"datetime":"2023-01-05T15:02:51.530-08:00","version":{"schema":0.743,"foundry":"10.291","system":"4.6.3"}}},"actionType":{"value":"passive"},"actionCategory":{"value":"offensive"},"actions":{"value":null},"requirements":{"value":""},"trigger":{"value":""},"deathNote":false},"_stats":{"systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"4.6.3","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1672959771578,"modifiedTime":1672959940677,"lastModifiedBy":"lxzmymmFddOcN8CB"},"folder":null,"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":0,"lxzmymmFddOcN8CB":3}}
