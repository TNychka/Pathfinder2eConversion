legendary artifice class feature gives you a 10th-level imbuement slot that works a bit differently from other imbuement catalysts.\n<h2>Artifice</h2>\n<p>As an artificer, you understand the fundamentals of magic and can tinker with its workings. You are adept at manipulating magic's core principles to create and infuse items with powerful imbuements, bestowing them with a vast range of magical effects. Through your artifice, you can rapidly fashion powerful tools that harness the fundamental magical forces of the universe.</p>\n<p>At 1st level, you select up to three 1st-level imbuements each morning from the imbuements in your formula book. The selected imbuements form your imbuement collection for the day. The number of imbuements you can select for your imbuement collection each day is noted in Table 6-2: Imbuement Catalysts Per Day. The only restriction is that you must select at least one 1st-level imbuement for your imbuement collection each time you prepare, ensuring that you can use all your imbuement catalysts each day.</p>\n<p>After selecting your imbuement collection, you ready your artificer's tools to produce these imbuements on the fly. You can use Quick Artifice to create any of the imbuements in your collection by using an imbuement catalyst of an appropriate level. Upon reaching 2nd-level imbuement slots, you can heighten any imbuement in your collection to a level that matches an available imbuement catalyst.</p>\n<p>Some of your imbuements require you to attempt a spell attack roll to see how effective they are or have your enemies roll against your spell DC (typically by attempting a saving throw). Since your key ability is Intelligence, your spell attack rolls and spell DCs use your Intelligence modifier.</p>\n<h3>Imbuement Catalysts</h3>\n<p>In addition to your artificer's tools, your artifice is fueled by your imbuement catalysts. Imbuement catalysts are small sets of magical components, dragonshards, and precious materials primed to imbue items with magic. Each day during your daily preparations, you create up to one 1st-level imbuement catalyst. Your imbuement catalysts are expended to fuel your artifice, most importantly for the Quick Artifice activity. Your imbuement catalysts are part of the bulk of your artificer's tools.</p>\n<p>As soon as you make your next daily preparations, your imbuement catalysts from the previous day lose their power and expire. While imbuement catalysts are magical physical objects, they cannot be duplicated, preserved, or created in any way other than during your daily preparations. Since imbuement catalysts are part of your unique set of tools and specialization of artifice, you cannot use any imbuement catalysts you did not prepare yourself.</p>\n<p>As you increase in level as an artificer, the number and strength of the imbuement catalysts you can prepare increases, as shown in Table 6-2: Imbuement Catalysts Per Day.</p>\n<h3>Imbuements</h3>\n<p>Artificers use imbuements, a unique form of magic created by infusing items with new magical effects fueled by imbuement catalysts. Although imbuements have the same rules and stat blocks as spells, they cannot be activated using the Cast a Spell activity or crafted into scrolls, wands, or staves. To apply an imbuement, artificers must use the Quick Artifice activity.</p>\n<p>As an artificer, you can also learn and use spells from your spellcasting tradition as imbuements. When using a spell as an imbuement, you cannot use any target except object or surface, and if the spell statblock's range is longer than touch, it becomes touch. As a result, some spells associated with your tradition list may not be used as imbuements as they require ranges, areas, or targets other than an object or surface - this includes stat blocks that do not list an object or surface target such as Mage Armour or Longstrider.</p>\n<p>When you gain new imbuements, you can choose to add spells from your tradition list to your formula book instead. Additionally, you can use the Learn a Spell activity to add new imbuements and spells you encounter during your adventures to your formula book. Imbuements are added using the crafting skill.</p>\n<h3>Formula book</h3>\n<p>Imbuements are precious innovations that artificers track with diligent notes. You start with a Formula Book worth 1gp or less which you receive for free. It contains all formulas for level-0 common items. In addition to crafting formulas, this formula book is your source of imbuements and contains all your notes on the imbuements you have access to, which you must study in order to prepare your imbuement collection each day. The Formula Book also gains your choice of four level-1 imbuements. Your formula book's form is up to you. It might be a grease-stained, leather-bound tome or an assortment of spellshards connected to a brass chain.</p>\n<p>Each time you gain a level, you add three more imbuements to your formula book, of any level up to your highest arcane fundamental level.</p>\n<h3>Quick Artifice</h3>\n<p>When you need to create a magical device or effect on the fly, you apply your knowledge of artifice to assemble imbuement slot using the @UUID[Compendium.pathfinders-guide-to-eberron-compendium.eberron-compendium-beta.e2W8MsbaudIQx0DA]{Quick Artifice} activity.</p>\n<h2>Magical Ingenuity</h2>\n<p>You manipulate materials together to replicate magic with inconceivable methods. You gain the @Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.xWY5omyIcILNR7y1]{Magical Crafting} skill feat, even if you don't meet its prerequisites, and you gain the four common up-to-2nd-level items granted by that feat.</p>\n<h2>Spell Replication</h2>\n<p>Using your magical ingenuity, you may attempt to improvise spell requirements for crafting even though do not have access to the Cast a Spell activity. If you have the spell in your formula book, you may supply the spell at any level up to your highest arcane fundamental as if you had the Cast a Spell activity.</p>\n<p>In addition, you gain the skill feat @Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.uR62fVC9FyQAMCO1]{Trick Magic Item}.</p>\n<h2>Artifice Specialization</h2>\n<p>Artifice has many paths to mastery, and your journey has led you to a specific specialization. You may have delved deep into the fundamentals of magic at an arcane institute, honed your skills on the front line of the last war, or have started your own magewright practice developing a unique approach to artifice that set you apart from your peers. This specialization is a blend of your unique talents and expertise, which shape the way you practice artifice.</p>\n<p>Specializations can be found here (@Compendium[pathfinders-guide-to-eberron-compendium.eberron-compendium-beta.6hAsIxiOqebW0dhR]{Traditional Specialization}, @Compendium[pathfinders-guide-to-eberron-compendium.eberron-compendium-beta.yOsgVOWkCS6mPkrQ]{Planar Specialization}, @Compendium[pathfinders-guide-to-eberron-compendium.eberron-compendium-beta.u3sn1YuOQsyiYi9f]{Spirit Specialization}, @Compendium[pathfinders-guide-to-eberron-compendium.eberron-compendium-beta.E3omHObWqwZqjDMs]{Vassal Specialization})</p>\n<h3>Traditional Specialization</h3>\n<p>As a traditional artificer, you follow the established field and theories of Artifice. With long-standing techniques developed and refined by the artificers before you, your work explores and expands upon their great work. You have studied the arcane arts extensively and can use this knowledge to imbue your items with arcane abilities.</p>\n<p>Your spellcasting tradition is Arcane.</p>\n<h3>Planar Specialization</h3>\n<p>As a Planar Artificer, you possess a deep knowledge of the arcane forces that underlie Eberron, and are able to channel these energies into your creations. You draw directly on the primal energies of the planes and ley lines. Instead of using standard arcane components, you may use pieces of the planes themselves to create temporary micro-manifest zones, giving you unparalleled control over the fundamental forces of reality.</p>\n<p>Your spellcasting tradition is Primal.</p>\n<h3>Spirit Specialization</h3>\n<p>As a Spirit Artificer, you have delved deep into the occult magic of the world, gaining knowledge of the mysterious and otherworldly. Your creations are imbued with eldritch powers, which you manipulate to create powerful occultic items. Instead of using conventional arcane components, you may call upon the such spirits of dolurrh to empower your items, or incorporate rare and esoteric materials into your work.</p>\n<p>Your spellcasting tradition is Occult.</p>\n<h3>Vassal Specialization</h3>\n<p>Vassal Artificers are masters of divine magic and specialize in infusing their creations with divine energy. You have a strong understanding of your religion and draw upon your faith to imbue items with powerful blessings and abilities. Through the use of sacred texts, rituals, or prayer, Vassal Artificers are able to imbue their creations with divine power.</p>\n<p>Your spellcasting tradition is Divine.</p>\n<h2>Artificer Feats</h2>\n<p>At 2nd level and every even-numbered level, you gain an artificer class feat. Most features and feats require you to have your artificer tools and imbuement slot available. If you are deprived of your gear for some reason, you might lose access to many feats and features, subject to GM discretion.</p>\n<h2>Skill Feats 2nd</h2>\n<p>At 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a skill feat. You must be trained or better in the corresponding skill to select a skill feat.</p>\n<h2>General Feats 3rd</h2>\n<p>At 3rd level and every 4 levels thereafter, you gain a general feat.</p>\n<h2>Skill Increases 3rd</h2>\n<p>At 3rd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a skill increase. You can use this increase to either become trained in one skill you're untrained in or become an expert in one skill in which you're already trained.</p>\n<p>At 7th level, you can use skill increases to become a master in a skill in which you're already an expert, and at 15th level, you can use them to become legendary in a skill in which you're already a master.</p>\n<h2>Skilled Expert 3rd</h2>\n<p>You've increased your skill in Artifice. You become an expert in Crafting.</p>\n<h2>Imbuement Expansion 5th</h2>\n<p>You gain the ability to utilize imbuements that have no target, typically because they directly empower you. When using a spell that has no target, you must select a reasonable worn object to hold the power of the imbuement. This may be your boots for longstrider, or your helmet for Illusory Disguise.</p>\n<h2>Ability Boosts 5th</h2>\n<p>At 5th level and every 5 levels thereafter, you boost four different ability scores. You can use these ability boosts to increase your ability scores above 18. Boosting an ability score increases it by 1 if it's already 18 or above, or by 2 if it starts out below 18.</p>\n<h2>Ancestry Feats 5th</h2>\n<p>In addition to the ancestry feat you started with, you gain an ancestry feat at 5th level and every 4 levels thereafter.</p>\n<h2>Artificer Weapon Expertise 5th</h2>\n<p>You develop tricks for using your weapons more effectively. Your proficiency ranks for simple weapons, martial crossbows, martial firearms, and unarmed attacks increase to expert. If using your artifice item attack with an item that has a critical specialization, you gain access to the critical specialization effect of the item.</p>\n<h2>Iron Will 7th</h2>\n<p>Your mental defences are an iron fortress. Your proficiency rank for Will saves increases to expert.</p>\n<h2>Skilled Master 7th</h2>\n<p>You've increased your skill in Artifice. You become a master in Crafting.</p>\n<h2>Weapon Specialization 7th</h2>\n<p>You fully understand your weapons. You deal 2 additional damage with weapons and unarmed attacks in which you are an expert. This damage increases to 3 if you're a master, and to 4 if you're legendary.</p>\n<h2>Artifice Expert 9th</h2>\n<p>Through innovation and experimentation, you've made your artifice creations more effective and reliable. Your proficiency ranks for your spell DC and spell attack increase to expert.</p>\n<h2>Alertness 9th</h2>\n<p>You remain alert to threats around you. Your proficiency rank for Perception increases to expert.</p>\n<h2>Evasion 11th</h2>\n<p>You’ve learned to move quickly to avoid explosions, dragon’s breath, and worse - your failed artifice experiments.
