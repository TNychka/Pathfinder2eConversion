A myrnaxe has a sturdy wooden haft with a curved axe blade on one end and a long spearhead on the other. Depending on the wielder's stance, the myrnaxe is either functionally a battleaxe or a spear. A user may switch between the sides of the myrnaxe with an interact action. The myrnaxe has the damage, hands, group, and weapon traits of the side in user. Myrnaxes are composed of two attached items: the&nbsp;<span style=\"font-family: var(--font-primary); font-size: var(--font-size-14);\">@Compendium[world.eberron-items.XzWmR7uLw7xNZzMT]{Myrnaxe Axehead}</span><span style=\"font-family: var(--font-primary); font-size: var(--font-size-14);\">, and the @Compendium[world.eberron-items.GaAXq0T4TQ2SZYkU]{Myrnaxe Spearhead}.

When crafting a myrnaxe, both sides are manufactured at the same time, using their respective crafting costs for material, and forming a completed Myrnaxe when finished. Each side of the weapon gains the effect of its respective precious material.
