# Pathfinder's Guide to Eberron  - Alpha Version 0.17.1

The Pathfinder's guide to Eberron is a (currently) incomplete homebrew conversion of the Pathfinder 2e mechanics to support the world and Lore of Eberron. It would be prohibitive to provide all of the lore that Eberron has developed over the years - and any lore provided by this guide would be poorly repeated imitations of better summaries. This guide uses the following books as references and will provide page numbers to learn more. [D&D 3 Eberron Campaign Setting](https://www.dmsguild.com/product/28474/Eberron-Campaign-Setting-3e) by Keith Baker, [Exploring Eberron](https://www.dmsguild.com/product/315887/Exploring-Eberron) by Keith Baker, and the [Eberronicon](https://www.dmsguild.com/product/297249/Eberronicon-A-Pocket-Guide-to-the-World). All of these are available for purchase on the [Dungeon Masters Guild](https://www.dmsguild.com/) and provide all of the background information you might need to run the world of Eberron.

## Why Pathfinder 2e?
Pathfinder 2e's levelling system supports the pulp action of Eberron well. At low levels, your adventurers will fight against threats to towns or cities, while at high levels these become trivial and adventurers' will be called on to fight one or more of the threats to nations or even the entire world.

Since Eberron was developed for the D&D 3 system, translating mechanics and items to Pathfinder 2e is frequently straightforward. The Pathfinder's Guide to Eberron primarily provides support for Ancestries, Dragonmarks, Equipment, Spells, and conversions of specific mechanics or lore of the world tied to the D&D 3 and D&D 5e. 

### Ancestries
There are several unique playable Ancestries in Eberron, such as the Bugbear, Eberron Changeling, Gnoll, Kalashtar, Shifter, and Warforged. The Pathfinder's Guide to Eberron provides support for these new ancestries, or ways to play them with the existing Pathfinder 2e ancestries.

With the Pathfinder 2e feats system, there are some feats which tie Golarian lore directly into Ancestry. Suggestions are provided for altering these to fit the world of Eberron (although mechanics are rarely changed). 

### Dragonmarks
Dragonmarks are a new system of focus spells provided by the Dragonmarks which manifest on many of the Ancestries present in the world of Eberron. This guide provides the steps and support to use Dragonmarks in Eberron.

### Equipment
With the wide magic of Eberron, access to magic items and crafting supplies is different from the world of Golarion. New magic items are provided, along with common more mundane adventuring gear and weapons.

### Spells
With the arms race brought about by the last war, and the magic of dragonmarks, several new spells are introduced into the world. Eberron is a wide-magic, but low-level-magic setting, so the majority of these spells are low level as well.

### Other
This guide also provides details about running the world of Eberron to the full extent  are some what minor guides for building NPCs and PCs that fit the rich lore of the world.
