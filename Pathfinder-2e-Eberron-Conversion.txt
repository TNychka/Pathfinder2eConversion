# The Pathfinder's Guide to Eberron ((Pathfinder's Guide to Eberron))
Train cars crackle with lightning as they thunder on elemental rails through the countryside. Veterans of a hundred-year war now not only defend their fragment of a shattered kingdom but protect against nameless horrors from apocalyptic mists. Dragonmarked monopolies dominate the trade of the Khorvaire and increasingly push the boundaries of their governing laws. The world is in desperate need of heroes, and only you can answer the call.
-
)
# What is Eberron? ((+What is Eberron))
Eberron started with a contest run by Wizards of the Coast to develop a new campaign setting. The winner of the competition was Keith Baker with the Eberron Campaign Setting. In 2005 after developing the setting in concert with Wizards of the Coast, the Eberron campaign setting was published for Dungeons and Dragons 3e. 

Eberron is a pulp-action world where morality is a shade of grey, but the call to adventure is always present. Adventure is everywhere, from the continent of Khorvaire: where arcane industry powered a hundred-year-war which now stands in an uneasy truce gone cold war; to Xen'drik where ancient ruins of the giant civilization wait to be discovered; there are many backdrops for a story in Eberron - and equally many dangers. Some of these dangers threaten nations, while others put the fate of the world at risk. Only a few legendary people can ever hope to stand against these threats, which is where the PCs come in. The need for heroes is desperate, but there is hope.

# Pathfinders' Guide to Eberron ((+Pathfinders' Guide to Eberron))
The Pathfinder's guide to Eberron provides Pathfinder 2e mechanics to support the gameplay of Eberron. It does not provide the lore or information required to run the Eberron setting. This guide suggests the following books as references [D&D 3 Eberron Campaign Setting](https://www.dmsguild.com/product/28474/Eberron-Campaign-Setting-3e) by Keith Baker, [D&D 5e Eberron: Rising from the Last War](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/erftlw) by Keith Baker, [Exploring Eberron](https://www.dmsguild.com/product/315887/Exploring-Eberron) by Keith Baker, and the [Eberronicon](https://www.dmsguild.com/product/297249/Eberronicon-A-Pocket-Guide-to-the-World). All of these are available for purchase on the [Dungeon Masters Guild](https://www.dmsguild.com/) and provide all of the background information you might need to run the world of Eberron.

## Using this guide
This guide aims to be as balanced and interesting as possible while using the pathfinder 2e base rules. If something seems too good - or too bad - to be true, it likely is. Work with your GM to figure out a better solution, and if possible submit a question to the [Github](https://github.com/TNychka/Pathfinder2eConversion/issues) for clarification or correction. All Uncommon and Rare traits should _always_ be verified with your GM.

### The World
There are a number of nations that have risen from the last war, and many continents, ancient empires, and other places that have been around far longer. This document provides stat blocks for all these locations including the planes and any planar effects.

### Languages
There are many varied languages in Eberron, and this document outlines the common, uncommon, and exotic languages of the world that you might encounter.

### Religions
Deities are tied into the mechanics of many of the Pathfinder 2e classes, this document provides the statblocks for their worship.

### Ancestries
There are several unique playable Ancestries in Eberron, such as the Bugbear, Eberron Changeling, Kalashtar, Shifter, and Warforged. The Pathfinder's Guide to Eberron provides support for these new ancestries or ways to play them with the existing Pathfinder 2e ancestries.

### Dragonmarks
Dragonmarks are a new system of focus spells provided by the Dragonmarks which manifest on many of the Ancestries present in the world of Eberron. This guide provides the steps and mechanical support to use Dragonmarks in Eberron.

### Equipment
With the wide magic of Eberron, access to magic items and crafting supplies is different from the world of Golarion. New magic items are provided, along with common more mundane adventuring gear and weapons.

### Spells
With the arms race brought about by the last war, and the magic of dragonmarks, several new spells are introduced into the world. Eberron is a wide-magic, but low-level-magic setting, so the majority of these spells are low-level as well.

### Other
There are many other details sourced from canon and kanon about running the world of Eberron to its full depth of lore. Eberron is a rich living world, and it can truly shine with some minor tweaks to the Pathfinder 2e system!

# Optional Rules ((Optional Rules))
Recommended and suggested rules from the Gamemastery Guide and other sources to change and capture the feel of Eberron.
-
)
Eberron is a world of swashbuckling adventure, noir mysteries, and can fit most other genres with ease. The following rules help improve both the GM's and the player's experience in Eberron and capture differences from the assumptions of the world of Golarion.

## World Details
- Dragonmarks are a unique and magical marking on the flesh of a creature. If you disguise yourself as a creature with a visible dragonmark, you take a -2 circumstance penalty to your attempts to deceive other characters. In addition, cosmetic changes fail to capture the true appearance of a dragonmark - or hide its presence.
- World levels on NPCs should be kept relatively low. Cantrips and 1st level spells are common, 2nd-3rd level spells become uncommon, while 4th-5th spells are rare and primarily on NPCs of note, and beyond 6th should be considered legendary - Unique rarity. Similarly, items become increasingly difficult to obtain, and the primary source of high-level items may be prototype items, or blueprints developed by Cannith, or from ancient ruins such as in Xen'drik. See the Services section for more information.
- Gunpower plays a large part in the pathfinder 2e core rules - the gunslinger, alchemist bomber, and various other items depend on black powder. If you keep these items, consider modifying black powder to instead be a powdered Eberron Shard substance called Siberys Powder. See the Wandslinger entry under classes, and the Siberys Powder item for more information. It maintains a similar effect but integrates the arcane nature of Eberron.

## Recommended
- The optional alignment variants rule of the Gamemastery guide suggests the "Extreme Good and Evil" modification, which is the primary lore design of Eberron. While creatures of the planes such as Daanvi, Irian, or Mabar _are_ strongly aligned creatures, on the material plane, things are a shade of grey. On the material plane, it is strongly suggested you use either the Moral Intentions or the No Alignment major variants - as to your preference. Many instances of the existing lore fall within these designs: the church of the silver flame is primarily good, however, it is responsible for the horrors of the Silver Purge; many dragons are various alignments and not the standard alignment of their colour; most rulers of the nations are good aligned - desipte waging a brutal hundred year war against each other with countless lives lost. It is quite possible to meet a good red dragon or an evil gold dragon. If alignment is required for a ruling consider the creature's general behaviour and motivations. Though a creature might generally be good, they are not beholden to always be good, and vice-versa. If you do make these changes, modify alignment damage "Good, Evil, Chaotic, Lawful" to "Radiant, Shadow, Chaos, Order" respectively. All creatures that are not strongly aligned (such as most creatures of the material plane) take no damage from these types or consider their general alignment when deciding whether it applies.
- PCs are part of the world of Eberron, and they have approximate knowledge of many of the intricacies of where they come from. Consider giving all players a free starting trained lore skill in the history and politics of their nation.

## Consider the following
- Free Archetype is an optional rule available in the Gamemastery Guide. The rule allows characters to become more diverse, and specialize in a greater selection of options. Eberron is a world in need of heroes, and this optional rule allows characters to stand out as increasingly special.
- Ancestry Paragon is an optional rule available in the Gamemastery Guide. If you have a dragonmarked character, you could consider adding this rule to enable the full powers of a dragonmark to manifest while allowing the selection of regular ancestry feats as well. Regular characters can benefit from channelling the archetype of their ancestry, perhaps as a champion of their people (such as a hero of the Valenar elves).
=
- Deep backgrounds are an excellent way to increase your player's connection to Eberron. Work with your players to build out their beginnings, or allow them to roll. 
- Ley Lines and Magical Terrain help capture the power of manifest zones. While the Planes entry details a few potential applications of these rules, you can consider enabling all of the features of Ley Lines and Magical Terrain to apply to manifest zones.
- Pervasive magic captures the wide magic feeling of Eberron. It's suggested that you follow the character creation of pervasive magic, and give NPCs access to the level 0 cantrips detailed in this document or uncommonly level 1 cantrips from any source. However, though magic is pervasive, it is low level. You should consider disregarding Creature Adjustments and only apply these widespread cantrips to intelligent humanoids.
- Hero points enable the heroic last-minute changes of luck that are the cornerstone of swashbuckling adventure. You could consider increasing the frequency with which you award hero points and even increasing the maximum number of hero points that a player can hold on to.
