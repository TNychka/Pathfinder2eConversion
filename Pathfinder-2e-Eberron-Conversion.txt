# The Pathfinders' Guide to Eberron ((Pathfinder's Guide to Eberron))
Train cars crackle with lightning as they thunder on elemental rails through the countryside. Veterans of a hundred-year war now not only defend their fragment of a shattered kingdom, but protect again nameless horrors from apocalyptic mists. Dragonmarked monopolies dominate the trade of the Khorvaire and increasingly push the boundaries of their governing laws. The world is in desperate need of heroes, and only you can answer the call. Welcome to the World of Eberron. This guide will help you run the Eberron Campaign setting using the Pathfinder 2e system.

# What is Eberron? ((+What is Eberron))
Eberron started with a contest run by Wizards of the Coast to develop a new campaign setting. The winner of the competition was Keith Baker with the Eberron Campaign Setting. In 2005 after developing the setting in concert with Wizards of the Coast, the Eberron campaign setting was published for Dungeons and Dragons 3e. 

Eberron is a pulp action world with widespread magic where morality is a shade of grey. There are many threats in the world of Eberron; some threatening nations, others the world, and few who can stop them. That's where the PCs come in, the need for heroes is desperate, but there is hope.

# What is the Pathfinder's Guide to Eberron ((+What is the Pathfinder's Guide to Eberron))

The Pathfinder's guide to Eberron is a homebrew conversion of the Pathfinder 2e mechanics to support the world and Lore of Eberron. It would be prohibitive to provide all of the lore that Eberron has developed over the years - and any lore provided by this guide would be poorly repeated imitations of better summaries. This guide uses the following books as references and will provide page numbers to learn more. [D&D 3 Eberron Campaign Setting](https://www.dmsguild.com/product/28474/Eberron-Campaign-Setting-3e) by Keith Baker, [Exploring Eberron](https://www.dmsguild.com/product/315887/Exploring-Eberron) by Keith Baker, and the [Eberronicon](https://www.dmsguild.com/product/297249/Eberronicon-A-Pocket-Guide-to-the-World). All of these are available for purchase on the [Dungeon Masters Guild](https://www.dmsguild.com/) and provide all of the background information you might need to run the world of Eberron.

info (
## D&D 3 Eberron Campaign Setting

The Eberron Campaign Setting (ECS) is the book that started it all. Released in 2005, this is the primary source of mechanics and lore added in this guide. It provides a detailed description of the world, mechanics, and lore.
-
## Exploring Eberron

Exploring Eberron (EE) independent book developed by Keith Baker focused on the D&D 5e system. Exploring Eberron explores in depth much of the world that never made the cut for official books.
-
## Eberronicon

The Eberronicon - A Pocket Guide to the World (EPG) is a community project that provides a high level summary of the world of Eberron and all of the lore to date.

## Why Pathfinder 2e? ((++Why Pathfinder 2e))
Pathfinder 2e's levelling system supports the pulp action of Eberron well. At low levels, your adventurers will fight against threats to towns or cities, while at high levels these become trivial and adventurers' will be called on to fight one or more of the threats to nations or even the entire world.

Since Eberron was developed for the D&D 3 system, translating mechanics and items to Pathfinder 2e is frequently straightforward. The Pathfinder's Guide to Eberron primarily provides support for Ancestries, Dragonmarks, Equipment, Spells, and conversions of specific mechanics or lore of the world tied to the D&D 3 and D&D 5e. 

### Ancestries
There are several unique playable Ancestries in Eberron, such as the Bugbear, Eberron Changeling, Gnoll, Kalashtar, Shifter, and Warforged. The Pathfinder's Guide to Eberron provides support for these new ancestries, or ways to play them with the existing Pathfinder 2e ancestries.

With the Pathfinder 2e feats system, there are some feats which tie Golarian lore directly into Ancestry. Suggestions are provided for altering these to fit the world of Eberron (although mechanics are rarely changed). 
|
### Dragonmarks
Dragonmarks are a new system of focus spells provided by the Dragonmarks which manifest on many of the Ancestries present in the world of Eberron. This guide provides the steps and support to use Dragonmarks in Eberron.

### Equipment
With the wide magic of Eberron, access to magic items and crafting supplies is different from the world of Golarion. New magic items are provided, along with common more mundane adventuring gear and weapons.

### Spells
With the arms race brought about by the last war, and the magic of dragonmarks, several new spells are introduced into the world. Eberron is a wide-magic, but low-level-magic setting, so the majority of these spells are low level as well.

### Other
This guide also provides details about running the world of Eberron to the full extent  are some what minor guides for building NPCs and PCs that fit the rich lore of the world.

# The World of Eberron ((The World of Eberron))
The world of Eberron is an interconnected network of Nations, Territories, and Ancient Empires. Ancient grudges, and fresh wounds simmer in the embers of the last war. Adwill play a major roll in the future of all of them.
-
)
right (
# National Lore
Most PCs will be natives to one of the Nations of Khorvaire. This nationality will likely be an important part of their character, so consider giving each PC a Trained Lore skill for their Nation.
# Regional Language
Languages in Eberron are typically based on location rather than Ancestry. When picking languages, consider the languages local to your home region. As a result of this approach to language, it wouldn't be unreasonable to have characters such as a Dwarf that cannot speak Dwarven or an Elf that only speaks Goblin.
)
# Nations and Territories((+Nations of Khorvaire))
As the Last War comes to an end, twelve nations now stand recognized amid the ashes by the Treaty of Thronehold. Although, not all territories are recognized - such as the recently formed Droaam. When building a PC, consider which Nations you lived in, and how the neighbouring nations affected you. How has it affected your past? 

For more information on the Nations at a high level: see the Eberronicon (p. 20) or more in-depth in the Eberron Campaign Setting (p. 129). All excerpts are from the Eberron Campaign Setting.

-
Destroyed at the end of the Last War, Cyre now exists only in the hearts of the refugees scattered across Khorvaire.

Before the war, Cyre was the seat of the kings and queens of Galifar. The wealth of the kingdom flowed through Cyre, and it was a nexus for commerce and culture. By tradition, Cyre’s Princess Mishann had the rightful claim to the throne of Galifar. Cyrans take pride that they alone were in the right in the Last War, but they unquestionably lost more to the war than any other nation. As a Cyran, you stand on the moral high ground, but that may offer little comfort.

In ages past, hobgoblins and other goblinoids controlled Khorvaire. Over the course of thousands of years a host of goblinoid nations rose and fell. The greatest civilization of this age, the hobgoblin Empire of Dhakaan, bred goblins and bugbears as slaves and warriors. The ancient empire has returned, in a weaker, less influential form, in the new nation of Darguun.

North of the Eldeen Reaches, life gradually seeps out of the earth. Lush forests fade to a broad tableland of dried soil and cracked rock. Further north, the elevation rises into the bleak chain of mountains known as the Shad-owcrags, then drops dramatically. The land beyond, a highland plateau, is broken into badlands, a network of canyons and mesas that forms a natural labyrinth leading out to a plain of blackened sand and volcanic glass. This is the Demon Wastes—the last remnants of the rakshasa civilization that ruled Khorvaire millions of years before the rise of goblinoids or humans. Amid ruins so old that they barely resemble the buildings they once were, fi endish creatures search for fresh blood while ancient forces watch from the shadows. In this realm of death and desolation, long-forgotten treasures and primeval secrets hide in the blasted wastes

-

Droaam is a nation ruled by monsters, established by the Daughters of Sora Kell in 986 YK. Few of the civilized races dare to test its borders. Their connection with the rest of Khorvaire is limited to a single House Orienroadway that passes through Graywall and into The Great Crag, and a beneficial business relationship with House Tharashk, who set up mercenary contracts between the inhabitants of Droaam and the outside world. Recently, the House has acquired permission to mine in Droaam, and they have begun exploitation of the nation's vast Byeshk mines and Eberron Dragonshard fields.

The Eldeen Reaches cover the northwestern region of Khor-vaire to the Shadowcrag Mountains. The eastern Reaches feature fertile plains and rolling hills, but dense forests cover the majority of the nation. These forests house some of the most primeval trees on the continent, ancient growths that have survived the rise and fall of empires and witnessed the arrival of humans on the shores of Khorvaire. The forces of magic permeate these woods, and strange beasts and mischievous fey roam the land. Many dangers also lurk in the deep woods, and the humanoids who make their homes in these forests don’t always take kindly to visitors.

-
Tradition, discipline, and excellence in all things define Karrnath. A nation with a proud military history, it has stood for centuries as the strongest of the Five Nations, producing the finest generals and armies the kingdom of Galifar has ever seen. These qualities proved the nation’s greatest asset, but also its greatest vulnerability, during the Last War. Although the nation never surrendered, an over reliance on military concerns left it unprepared for different kinds of enemies—plague, famine, and intrigue.

A loose confederacy of pirate lords, sea barons, and mer-chant princes controls the area east of the Hoarfrost Moun-tains. This strip of the continent’s eastern shore, along with the chain of islands that wraps around the coast and extends north into the Bitter Sea, makes up the region known as the Lhazaar Principalities. Named for the near-mythic explorer who led the humans to Khorvaire some three thousand years ago, the Lhazaar Principalities have always been grouped together—even though the individual princes rarely see themselves as part of a greater whole.

Commonly, the region known as the Shadow Marches conjures images of a fetid backwater where illiterate humans  mingle  with  orcs  and  other  foul  creatures, and practice strange rites by the light of the moons. These images are accurate—to a point. A desolate land of swamps and moors, the Shadow Marches have been orc territory for more than thirty thousand years. The region has suffered through a terrible war against the daelkyr that scarred the land, stranded horrible creatures in the shadows, and divided the orc tribes. The daelkyr were eventually defeated, but the schisms caused by the war remain.

In the midst of the Last War, an army of Tairnadal warrior elves from Aerenal seized this region from Cyre, invoking a claim to the land from long before humanity’s arrival on the continent. The elves of Valenar devote themselves to the arts of war. Their cavalry has no equal in Khorvaire, and they combine a talent for magic with stealth and swordplay. Cyre employed the Valenar as mercenaries until the elves betrayed Cyre and took a corner of the nation for themselves. These lands escaped the destruction visited upon the rest of Cyre. After the Mourning, no one wanted to challenge the Valenar’s claim to the land they had taken; in the interests of peace, the Treaty of Thronehold recognized the new elf kingdom of Valenar.

# Core Ancestries ((++Core Ancestries))
Pathfinder 2e integrates a significant amount of Golarian lore into the mechanics and feats of core ancestries. While all of the mechanics are solid, the flavour associated with the ancestries and their feats occassionally diverge from the flavour or lore of Eberron. In the majority of cases it is close enough to Eberron that it doesn't warrant a rewrite, however you should consider modifying the flavour of your PC to fit the world of Eberron. As always, work with your GM if you are unsure.

This guide doesn't aim to provide information about the Ancestries, but instead guidance about implementing their mechanics in the world.

For more information about the Ancestries of Eberron, see the Eberronicon entries.

The Pathfinder 2e mapping is denoted in brackets if necessary. All of the following ancestries note their rarity, which replaces any pre-existing rarity trait if it exists.
|
## Bugbears
Bugbears are **uncommon** in the world of Eberron. Bugbears (also referred to as the Guul'dar) in Eberron are primarily residents of the nation of Darguun and Droaam, and less monsterous than is typical of the Bugbears in Pathfinder 2e.

The Bugbear Ancestry is provided in this document.

For more information on Goblinoids of Eberron, see Exploring Eberron (p. 96). 

## Dwarves
Dwarves are **common** in the world of Eberron. Dwarves of Eberron are well represented by the Pathfinder 2e implementation.

This document introduces lore adjustments, additional heritages and feats which can be used for additional flavour on top of the Pathfinder 2e Dwarves Ancestry.

For more information on the Dwarves, see Exploring Eberron (p.112)

## Drow
Drow are an Ancestry that are something of a hot topic. Drow in Eberron (like all Ancestries) are not inherently tied to any specific alignment. Drow do exist in Eberron, primarily on the continent of Xen'drik. It would not be unreasonable (although it would be uncommon) to see Drow on the continent of Khorvaire. Drow are **uncommon** in the world of Eberron.

If playing a Drow, use the Elf Ancestry with one of the Cavern Elf, Seer Elf, or Whisper Elf.

For more information on the drow, see the Eberronicon (p. 8).

note(
The use of these Heritages for Drow does not preclude their use with Non-Drow Elves. With GM permission, you could also use any Elf Heritage to play a Drow.
)

## Eberron Changelings
The Changelings presented in the Pathfinder 2e rules, and Eberron Changelings are significantly different in their lore and mechanical implementation. While Pathfinder 2e changelings are the decendents of Hags, Eberron changelings are a unique shapeshifting Ancestry. Changelings are **uncommon** in the world of Eberron.

The Eberron Changeling Ancestry is provided in this document.

For more information on Changelings of Eberron, see Exploring Eberron (p. 33). 
=
## Elves
Elves are **common** in the world of Eberron. Elves of Eberron are well represented by the Pathfinder 2e implementation.

This document introduces lore adjustments, additional heritages and feats which can be used for additional flavour on top of the Pathfinder 2e Elf Ancestry.

For more information on Elves of Eberron, see Eberron Campaign Setting (p. 14).

## Gnolls
Gnolls are **uncommon** in the world of Eberron. Gnolls in Eberron are close, but not quite the same as the Pathfinder 2e implementation. Gnolls of Eberron are instead a pact of clans that has managed to break free of the bindings of the Overlords, and has developed as a fiercely independent mercenary culture.

This document introduces lore adjustments, additional heritages and feats which can be used for additional flavour on top of the Pathfinder 2e Gnoll Ancestry.

For more information on Gnolls of Eberron, see Exploring Eberron (p. 93.)

## Gnomes
Gnomes are **common** in the world of Eberron. Pathfinder 2e gnomes are significantly more Fey aligned than the standard Eberron gnome, which results in feats and heritages that don't quite align with the Eberron vision of gnomes. However, these differences are primarily lore based and relatively easily adjusted. 

This document introduces lore adjustments, additional heritages and feats which can be used for additional flavour on top of the Pathfinder 2e gnome ancestry.

For more information on Gnomes of Eberron, see Eberron Campaign Setting (p. 14).

## Goblins
Goblins are **common** in the world of Eberron. Pathfinder 2e has made significant modifications to the Goblin Ancestry to provide additional flavour. While this deviates from the world of Eberron, it adds additional fun lore for the DM to work with that should be fairly simple to integrate into the world. Goblins (also referred to as the Golin'dar) in Eberron are primarily residents of the nation of Darguun and Droaam.

This document introduces lore adjustments, additional heritages and feats which can be used for additional flavour on top of the Pathfinder 2e goblin Ancestry.

For more information on Goblinoids of Eberron, see Exploring Eberron (p. 96). 
|
## Half-Elves
Half-Elves are **common** in the world of Eberron. Also called Khoravar, the vast majority of Khoravar are the decendents of two Half-Elves rather than a Human and Elf parent. While Pathfinder 2e provides the rules to apply the Half-Elf ancestry to non-human Ancestries, this should be considered **rare**.

This document introduces lore adjustments, additional heritages and feats which can be used for additional flavour on top of the Pathfinder 2e half-elf heritage.

For more information on Khoravar of Eberron, see Eberron Campaign Setting (p. 15). 

## Half-Orcs
Half-Orcs are **common** in the world of Eberron. Half-Orcs lineages are more varied than the Half-Elves. It is as likely as not that your parents were Human and Orc as both Half-Orc. While Pathfinder 2e provides the rules to apply the Half-Orc ancestry to non-human Ancestries, this should be considered **uncommon**.

This document introduces lore adjustments, additional heritages and feats which can be used for additional flavour on top of the Pathfinder 2e half-orc heritage.

For more information on Khoravar of Eberron, see Eberron Campaign Setting (p. 16). 

## Halflings
Halflings are **common** in the world of Eberron. Halflings of Eberron are well represented by the Pathfinder 2e implementation.

This document introduces lore adjustments, additional heritages and feats which can be used for additional flavour on top of the Pathfinder 2e halfling Ancestry.

For more information on Halflings, see Eberron Campaign Setting (p. 16).

## Hobgoblins
Hobgoblins are **uncommon** in the world of Eberron. Hobgoblins (also referred to as the Ghaal'dar) in Eberron are primarily residents of the nation of Darguun and Droaam, and less monsterous than is typical of the Hobgoblins in Pathfinder 2e. Pathfinder 2e has made significant modifications to the hobgoblins ancestry to provide additional flavour. This deviates from the world of Eberron, and unlike the goblin, these changes are more difficult to integrate with the world of Eberron.

This document introduces lore adjustments, additional heritages and feats which can be used for additional flavour on top of the Pathfinder 2e Hobgoblins Ancestry.

For more information on Goblinoids of Eberron, see Exploring Eberron (p. 96).

## Humans
Humans are **common** in the world of Eberron. Humans of Eberron are well represented by the Pathfinder 2e implementation.

This document introduces lore adjustments, additional heritages and feats which can be used for additional flavour on top of the Pathfinder 2e Humans Ancestry.

For more information on Humans, see Eberron Campaign Setting (p. 12).

## Kalashtar
Kalashtar are **uncommon** in the world of Eberron. Kalashtar are a unique Ancestry to Eberron. Kalashtar were born with a bond to an otherworldly being. They have memories of a life they've never lived, vision of battling fiends and an endless struggle against darkness. 

The Kalashtar Ancestry is provided in this document.

For more information on Kalashtar, see Exploring Eberron (p. 40). 

## Kobolds
Kobolds are **common** in the world of Eberron. Kobolds of Eberron are well represented by the Pathfinder 2e implementation.

This document introduces lore adjustments, additional heritages and feats which can be used for additional flavour on top of the Pathfinder 2e Kobolds Ancestry.

For more information on Kobolds, see the Eberronicon (p. 14).

## Lizardfolk
Lizardfolk are **uncommon** in the world of Eberron. Lizardfolk of Eberron are well represented by the Pathfinder 2e implementation.

This document introduces lore adjustments, additional heritages and feats which can be used for additional flavour on top of the Pathfinder 2e Lizardfolk Ancestry.

For more information on Kobolds, see the Eberronicon (p. 15).

## Orcs
Orcs are **common** in the world of Eberron. Orcs of Eberron are well represented by the Pathfinder 2e implementation. Orcs of Eberron have deep history with the world, which warrants a read.

This document introduces lore adjustments, additional heritages and feats which can be used for additional flavour on top of the Pathfinder 2e orc Ancestry.

For more information on Orcs, see the Eberronicon (p. 15).
|

## Shifters (Beastkin)
Shifters are **uncommon** in the world of Eberron. Shifters are well represented by applying the Beastkin versatile heritage to the Human Ancestry. When you chose your animal type, the Shifters of Eberron are primarily of the following animalistic traits. Beasthide (Bear, Boar); Longtooth (Tiger, Wolf); Swiftstride (Tiger, Rat, Leopard); Wildhunt (Wolf, Rat, Tiger); Cliffwalk (Monkey); Razorclaw (Leopard. Tiger). Other Beastkin animals presented by the Core Pathfinder 2e rules should be considered **rare**.

This document introduces lore adjustments, additional heritages and feats which can be used for additional flavour on top of the Pathfinder 2e Lizardfolk Ancestry.

note(
Shifters are native to the deepest parts of the Eldeen Reaches, it is likely that many of the variations of Shifters are yet undiscovered. As such, consider allowing the PCs to play Catfolk, Ratfolk, Kitsune, Tengu, or Shoony Ancestries as Shifters of Eberron who are more integrated with their animalistic traits.
)

## Warforged
Warforged are **common** in the world of Eberron. Warforged are a unique Ancestry to Eberron. Warforged were created as soldiers of war, and now as the last war ends many of them have lost their purpose. Consider what this means for you.

Warforged will likely use the Automatron Ancestry in the Guns and Gears rule set. As such, this document does not yet provide any way to play a warforged.

For more information on Warforged, see Exploring Eberron (p. 45.)
=
# Versatile Ancestries ((++Versatile Ancestries))
There exist instances of canon NPCs throughout the world of with the following Versatile Ancestries, as such they are Uncommon in rarity. However, the following Ancesties are typically the result of unique circumstances around the birth of a child. 

## Aasimar
Aasimar of Eberron are well represented by the Pathfinder 2e implementation.

For more information on Aasimar, see Exploring Eberron (p. 77)

## Tieflings
Tieflings of Eberron are well represented by the Pathfinder 2e implementation.

For more information on Tieflings, see the Eberronicon (p. 16).

# Exotic Ancestries ((++Exotic Ancestries))
note (
# Dragonborn
Dragonborn are an addition to the world of Eberron as of D&D 4e. Given that they are unique to D&D, that Pazio has (intentionally) avoided implementing their statistics, and that Dragonborn are a late introduction to the world of Eberron, this document does not note them as a Core race and will not provide statistics. If dragonborn are particularly interesting to you consider the either of the Lizardfolk or Kobold Ancestry which have established cultures in Eberron. As always, talk to your GM.
)

The following Ancestries exist in Pathfinder 2e, however they do not have any equivalent (or common equivalent) in the world of Eberron. If an Ancestry isn't directly noted in this document, it should be considered an Exotic Ancestry. All Exotic Ancestries gain the Rare trait, replacing other rarity traits they may have. The following are all suggestions about how you might be able to integrate them into your Eberron.

## Azarketi
An ancestry native to the depths of the Thunder Sea. While much of the Ancesty's lore does not apply in Eberron, the mechanics are sound.

For more information, see Exploring Eberron (p. 127).

An ancestry native to the Plane of Daanvi, or one of Daanvi's manifest zones. 

For more information, see Exploring Eberron (p. 149).

## Catfolk

## Changeling
Not much needs to change to implement Pathfinder Changelings in Eberron. However, given the overlap in naming and uncommon nature of the Ancestry, it is denoted as exotic. If using Pathfinder Changelings, consider them entirely distinct from Eberron Changelings.

## Dhampir
An ancestry native to the Plane of Mabar, or one of Mabar's manifest zones. 

For more information, see Exploring Eberron (p. 177).

Oreads are difficult to place. Consider them as an ancestry native to the Plane of Risia, or the Plane of Fernia. If not from the plane itself, then one of the respective manifest zones. 

For more information, see Exploring Eberron (p. 161, 182).

## Ratfolk
A unique sub-ancestry of Shifter native to the Eldeen Reaches, or the Lhazaar Principalities.

## Fleshwarp
An ancestry native to the Plane of Xoriat, or one of Xoriat's manifest zones. Alternatively, you could be the result of one of Mordain the Fleshweaver's experiments.

## Bugbears ((+Bugbears))
Dhakaani bugbears are known as Guul’dar, “strong folk,” and are celebrated for their strength and courage. Though they appear slow, they are capable of great bursts of strength or speed when necessary. Many yearn to prove their mettle on the battlefield, risking their lives to earn the glory known as atcha. Others instead find themselves at peace in small isolated clans, moving in flow with the nature around them.
)
Bugbears are storybook monsters in the tales and nightmares of many peoples. Stories speak of bugbears as great, hairy beasts that lurk in the shadows - waiting silently to spring their ambush. That if you stay off the beaten path or wander too far from your parents, a bugbear will reach out of the shadows and silently strangle you. If you leave the protection of your town at night, bugbears will drag you to their den to devour you alive. If a bugbear cuts off your head, your soul will never reach dolurrh.

These terrible stories of bugbears flowered from seeds of truth. Most bugbears rely on stealth and strength to attack, using great bursts of energy to end fights before the enemy is even aware they are there. Most bugbears even prefer to work at night, aiding their natural stealth despite their great size. While there are stories of bugbear mercenaries taking heads of enemy leaders during the last war, bugbears are no more likely to eat people indiscriminately than humans are. As for the bugbears of the forests, many follow the peace and flow of nature rather than the violence of war. There are many a story of stoic bugbear rangers or druids guiding lost troops through impossible terrain to safety during the war.

Now, as the nation of Darguun forms out of the ashes of the last war, the Guul'dar once again have an increasing presence in the civilized parts of the continent of Khorvaire.
## You might...
- Present an air of indolence the hides the vicious ferocity you display in battle.
- Use your great strength, long limbs, and endurance to perform feats of athletics that few others are capable of.
- Move slowly and in time with the world around you, listening and waiting until the time is right to expend your energy.
|
## Others Probably...
- Walk and talk cautiously around you, in fear of invoking your ire.
- Look to use your might to their advantage, assuming that you are easily outsmarted.
- Underestimate your silent step - assuming that your great mass could not possibly move as quietly as the stories say.

## Physical Description...
These stealthy and strong goblinoid creatures can thrive in the mayhem of battle and move slowly with the world around them - conserving great reserves of energy until needed. Standing between 6 to 8 feet tall and 250 to 300lbs, bugbears outsize most humanoids that they meet. Bugbears are typically extremely muscular, able to lift and move great weights with their long limbs. They are covered in thick short yellowish fur and share the same pointed ears as their goblinoid cousins. Using their long limbs bugbears can wield weapons with greater reach than most.

Despite their great size, Bugbears show an uncanny ability to sneak up on the unsuspecting. They can use their quiet step and darkvision to move quietly through the night. Unnoticed if they so desire.

Bugbears reach physical adulthood around the age of 16, and they can live up to 80 years. However, given that most strive for glory in battle or perform dangerous manual labour, death by old age is relatively uncommon among Bugbears.

## Society...
The goblinoid society of Darguun is "bound together both by the philosophy of muut and atcha and by the spiritual connection of the Uul Dhakaan. Their lives are shaped by a relentless martial culture and a rigid caste system."[1]

)
"Muut is typically translated as 'duty,' though it can also be seen as 'the honor of the empire'— something everyone must work to maintain. Muut is what is expected of you, what you owe to your comrades. Dhakaani don’t expect thanks for doing something that has to be done; rather, they are disgusted by those who shirk their responsibilities. The closest dar equivalent to “thank you” is ta muut, which simply means, 'You do your duty.'

By contrast, atcha refers to 'personal honor' or 'glory,' an opportunity to exceed what is required of you. No dar is content to simply do what is expected; the quest for atcha is a powerful driving force that urges dar to chase their full potential. In battle, the exhortation paatcha means, 'This is a chance to gain honor!'"[2] 

However, not all bugbears are part of the Dhakaani, and many of these bugbears are integrated with the cultures around them. Some may have adopted the human cultures of the cities in which they were born or the druidic customs of their isolated clans in the forests of the world.

note(
See Exploring Eberron (p. 96) for more information on Dhakaani Society.
)
## Alignment and Religion...
The Alignment and Religion of an individual bugbear depends on the culture in which they were raised. For the bugbears of the Dhakaani empire, their alignment is driven to a lawful behaviour as fits their spiritual connection to the empire.

"The general mindset of the dar is ill-suited to the abstract concept of faith, whether in higher powers or the world itself. They believe in the past. They believe in their leaders. But they don’t believe that there are cosmic powers or prophecies that control fate."[3]

## Names...
Goblinoid names often feature drawn-out vowel sounds (represented by doubled letters), as seen in the names of both their ancient empire (Dhakaan) and their newborn country (Darguun). Goblins, hobgoblins, and bugbears use the same names and naming conventions, despite their tribal differences.[4]

## Dwarves ((+Dwarves))
The origin of the dwarves is shrouded in mystery. Some of their legends tell of a great migration that led the ancient dwarves to Khorvaire from “a land of endless ice.” Many believe this refers to the arctic lands of the Frostfell, while others claim that the first dwarves must have come from the frozen plane of Risia. Wherever their roots, these migrant dwarves established a mighty nation beneath the surface of Khorvaire.

## Eberron Changelings ((+Eberron Changelings))
Long ago there was a woman named Jes, and she had one hundred children. Her rivals conspired against her and swore to kill her children. Jes begged the Sovereigns for help, but their only answer was the wind and rain. In the depths of her despair, a lonely Traveller took her hand. “I will protect your children if they follow my path. Let them wander the world. They may be shunned and feared, but they will never be destroyed.” Jes agreed, and the Traveller gave her his cloak. When she draped it over her children, their old faces melted away and they could be whoever they wanted to be. And so it remains. Though the children are shunned by all, the gift of the Traveler protects them still.
-
)
Changelings can shift their forms with a thought. Many changelings use this gift as a form of artistic and emotional expression. It’s also an invaluable tool for grifters, spies, and others who wish to deceive. This leads many people to treat changelings with suspicion.

Wherever humans live, changelings reside also; the question is whether their presence is known.

Changelings are born to one of three paths. A few are raised in stable communities where changelings are true to their nature and deal openly with the people around them. Some are orphans, raised by other races, who find their way in the world without ever knowing another like themselves. Others are part of nomadic changeling clans spread across the Five Nations, families who keep their true nature hidden from the single-skins. Some clans maintain safe havens in major cities and communities, but most prefer to wander the unpredictable path of the god known as the Traveler. [5]

## You might...
- Shift your shape to a persona that matches your mood or current activity. Though you, never use a particular form for too long before moving on to the next.
- Travel light, and keep an eye on the road, never settling down - whether that be a fear of being driven away or simply a restless desire to travel.
- Take great interest in the people around you, their stories, and their histories. After all, these new learnings might be the basis for one of your future personas.
## Others Probably...
- Others assume that because you have the uncanny ability to change their faces at will, that you will use it for malevolent ends, cheating honest folk before moving on.
- Employ you for your ability to shift your shape to any number of forms, whether this is for entertainment, acting, or protection.
- Don't understand the fluid nature you have with gender, form, or personality.
|
## Physical Description...
Changelings are typically 5 to 6ft tall, weighing between 120 to 180lbs. Their base form is a nondescript humanoid shape with white skin, hair, and featureless eyes - not unlike a manikin. Beyond this, because of their ability to shift-shape changelings do not have a set physical description.

## Society...
Changeling society is fragmented, and no two groups of changelings have the same culture. See Exploring Eberron pg. 33 for more information about the various types of changeling cultures.

## Alignment and Religion...
Changelings tend towards pragmatic neutrality, though few changelings embrace evil. As changelings are primarily products of the culture in which they grow, their alignment tends to match the alignment of their peers. Similarly, for religion, a changeling is likely to follow the dominant faith of their peers. However, most changelings find a connection to the Traveller of the dark six and a draw towards chaotic tendencies as if the Traveller still guides them.

## Names...
A changeling might use a different name for each mask and persona and adopt new names as easily as they change faces. The true name of a changeling tends to be simple and monosyllabic; however, there are often accents to a changeling’s name that are expressed through shapeshifting, something single-skins will likely miss. So, two changelings might have the name Jin, but one is Jin-with-vivid-blue-eyes and one is Jin-with-golden-nails.

Changelings have a fluid relationship with gender, seeing it as one characteristic to change among many. [5]

# Shift shape :aaa:
-
; concentrate,Occult,Eberron Changeling,Polymorph,Transmutation
**Frequency** Once per 10 minutes
-
You can change your appearance and your voice. You determine the specifics of the changes, including your colouration, hair length, and sex. You can also adjust your height and weight, but not so much that your size changes. You can make yourself appear as a member of another ancestry, although your game statistics do not change. You cannot duplicate the appearance of a creature you have never seen, and you must adopt a form that has the same basic arrangement of limbs that you have. However, your clothing and equipment are unchanged by this trait.

Shift shape counts as setting up a disguise for the Impersonate use of Deception; it ignores any circumstance penalties you might take for disguising yourself as a dissimilar creature, it gives you a +4 status bonus to Deception checks to prevent others from seeing that you are a shapeshifted changeling, and you add your level even if you're untrained. You can Dismiss this spell.

**Special** You stay in the new form until you use shift shape to revert to your true form or until you die.
)
note(
As per the wording of shift shape, it requires two applications of shift shape to change from one disguise to another. Once to revert to your true form, and once to shift to the new disguise.
)
# Changeling Heritages
Changelings are nearly homogenous in their physiology, however the formitive years of a changeling have a large impact on their future. Choose one of the following changeling heritages at 1st level.

## Changeling Traveler
You're an urban nomad, wandering from city to city. You become trained in the Society Skill (or another skill if you were already trained in Society) and gain the Streetwise skill feat. You have experience fitting into the local culture and blending with the common folk, so you're easily able to get a feel for the pulse of the local settlement. You may use the streetwise skill in any settlement in which you have spent at least a day.

## Hidden Changeling
While changelings are common in major cities, there are many villages and towns where changelings are treated with fear and suspicion. You might have been born into such a community, possibly never even knowing another changeling. As a hidden changeling, you have crafted a single identity that you consider to be your true face. You gain a +4 circumstance bonus to Impersonate checks to pretend you are of the ancestry which you were raised as. In addition, you gain the adopted ancestry feat for that ancestry.

note(
While you gain a circumstance bonus to pretend you are of an ancestry, this does not apply to deception checks you make while you are that ancestry. For instance, a human guard might be unable to see that you are not human and are actually a shapeshifted changeling, but might still be able to see that you are not the guard you are pretending to be.
)

## Persona Changeling
You have developed multiple personas that have developed as entirely separate lives - and are connected to the network of changeling personas across Khorvaire. You gain the Different Worlds feat. In addition, when you approach a new community you may already be aware of local changeling personas that you can use. At the GM's discretion, make a DC 15 flat check. If you succeed, you may interact with this settlement as if you had a second identity from the Different Worlds feat, but without the benefit of the lore skill. You could have already established a persona as a priest who will receive sustenance at the local temple, a folk hero who will be sheltered by the common people, or a veteran soldier who can always get a bed at the local garrison. Once this check has been made against a settlement, you may not make it again for another month.

## Watchful Changeling 
You're experienced with the deceptions of shapeshifters, given that you specialize in it. You are trained in the Deception skill (or another skill if you were already trained in Deception), and gain the Lie To Me skill feat. In addition, you gain a +2 circumstance bonus to detect polymorphed creatures.

# Ancestry Feats
At 1st level, you gain one ancestry feat, and you gain an additional ancestry feat every 4 levels thereafter (at 5th, 9th, 13th, and 17th levels). As a Changeling, you select from among the following ancestry feats.
#### 1st level

A lifetime of experience helps you see through disguises.

# Skin Cant

You are familiar with the innate language of changelings and have picked up languages beyond this. You gain the Skin Cant language and an additional common language of your choice. In addition, if you spend a week of downtime training someone, they can learn to pick up on single word messages.
)
info (
## Skin Cant ((++Skin Cant))
 Skin cant is a method of visual communication available only to Changelings, though others may learn to understand it. You can shift your appearance in subtle ways to communicate messages to others who understand the language. This form of communication only has the visual trait.

item(
# The Traveller's Gift
## feat 1
-
; Eberron Changeling
Have you heard of the Traveller? As a changeling whether or not you have, you have developed a knack for the Traveller's talents. Choose one cantrip from the occult spell list. You can cast this spell as an occult innate spell at will. A cantrip is heightened to a spell level equal to half your level rounded up.

Performing for others has always been second nature to you. You gain the Virtuosic Performer skill feat.

If you do so, the circumstance bonus is +2 whether or not you are master in performance.

)
=
#### 5th level
item(
# Climbing Adaptation
## Feat 5
-
; Eberron Changeling
 When you use Shift Shape, you can choose one to manifest an increased climbing ability. This can be a set of claws, modified arms, or some other set of obvious physical changes that aid your climb. You gain a climb speed equal to half your walking speed. These changes are obvious to observers.
)
item(
# Deep Shift
## Feat 5
-
; Eberron Changeling
Your ability to shape change is more than skin deep. When you use Shift Shape, the form you shift into no longer needs to have the same basic arrangement or number of limbs. You can transform into a form similar to any medium creature; humanoid, beast, or otherwise. You can add or remove limbs, digits, or even organs. Any feature added beyond your normal features (such as additional eyes, legs, or hands) is non-functional beyond the basics of keeping up appearances. Any removed features limit your physical abilities respectively. For instance, if you shift your shape to have no limbs then you similarly lose the ability to move and manipulate objects. These transformations can never modify your mental statistics.

You cannot create non-fleshy materials such as chitin or metal plates. So though you could shape yourself into a construct creature, the material is very clearly flesh and is insufficient to deceive observers.

In addition, your gear does not change shape with you and may not fit the form you choose to transform into if it is significantly different (such as shift shaping from your humanoid form into a wolf).
)
note(
The intent of the deep shift feat is to allow a changeling to take on a visual appearance of any fleshy creature, and perform basic actions for the purposes of deception or performance. The shift should generally not provide any new abilities, movements, or otherwise, that a simple visual change doesn't support. Similarly, it should generally not remove standard abilities, movements, or otherwise of the character unless the new form clearly does not support the continued use of the feature.
)

item(
# Emotional Empathy
## Feat 5

; Eberron Changeling
**Frequency** Once per minute
-
You are in tune with the emotions of those around you. You gain a +2 circumstance bonus to perception checks to sense motive. If you succeed on a sense motive check (even if it reveals nothing), you gain a +1 circumstance bonus to the next Diplomacy, Deception, or Intimidation check you make to interact with the creature.

item(
# Skin Glider :r:
## Feat 5

**Trigger** You begin to fall more than 30 feet.
-
When you begin to fall, you're able to shift your shape to maximize your air resistance, not unlike a flying squirrel. Your fall slows to 60 feet per round. This rapid change is extremely obvious to any observers watching, and all of them become aware that you are a changeling.

**Special** If you have the Rapid Shift feat, the trigger is instead when you begin to fall more than 5 feet.
)

#### 9th level
item(
# Amorphous
## Feat 9
-
; Eberron Changeling
You have managed to develop a malleability that allows you to change the size of your transformations. When you shift shape, you can take on small or large forms. You are subject to the restrictions, but do not gain any bonuses from the new form (such as the ability to wield larger weapons).
)
item(
# Aquatic Adaptation
## Feat 9
-
; Eberron Changeling

When you use Shift Shape, you can choose one to manifest gills and webbing between your fingers. You can breathe underwater and gain a swimming speed equal to your walking speed. These changes are obvious to observers.
)
item(
# Mind of the Traveller
## Feat 9
-
; Eberron Changeling
The Traveller's gifts have manifested an ability for you to read others, and see or trouble before it happens. You can cast mind reading once per day as an occult innate spell. When you do so, mind reading loses the verbal and somatic casting requirements, and a critical failure becomes a failure instead.
)
=
item(
# Rapid Regeneration
## Feat 9
-
; Eberron Changeling
**Frequency** once per day
-
You're able to shift your shape to repair wounds and injuries. You gain fast healing equal to half your level for 1 minute. While Rapid Regeneration is active, you revert to your base changeling form and can't use shift shape. This counts against the frequency of your shift shape.
)
item(
# Skin Dancer
## Feat 9
-
; Eberron Changeling
**Prerequisite** Expert in Performance.
-
You are a master of the unique changeling art of skin dancing. You are able to create intricate patterns and even images on your skin, and shift them about in mesmerizing ways. You can achieve effects such lighting coursing up your arms, or and fire dancing in a crown around your brow. 

You gain the Virtuosic Performer skill feat in the specialty of dance (if you already have the Virtuosic Performer in dance, you may choose an additional different specialty). When you use the Virtuosic Performer feat for dance, you gain a +1 status bonus if you augment your performance with a special use of shift shape, or +2 if you are Legendary in Performance. This use counts against the frequency, but lasts for the full duration of your performance.

**Special** Skin dancer counts for the favourable form of the Personable Performer feat as well.
)

item(
# Marvelous Mimic
## Feat 13
-
; Eberron Changeling
**Prerequisite** Deep Shift
-
Your ability to change is at a level only seen in true mimics. When you shift shape, you can take on the appearance of any medium creature or object - within practical limits. This transformation doesn't change your statistics in any way, and you don't gain any special abilities of the form you assume (including potential functional features of an object - such as a key, ladder, rope, or crowbar).

You can recreate non-fleshy materials such as chitin or metal plates such that they are visually and tactilely deceptive to quick inspections. Materials created in this way do not have any functional properties of the material.

With a rapid change of your form, you take on a monstrous form for an instant before shifting back. When you Demoralize, you can choose to replace the auditory trait and with the visual trait. You can then attempt a demoralize check against each enemy that can see you within 30 feet.

item(
# The Traveller's Protection :r:

With your ability to read a situation and change your form in precise and subtle ways, people second-guess whether or not they actually did see through disguise - as if the Traveller protects you still.

If a creature succeeds on a check to see through your impersonation, you become aware of their increasing disbelief. The GM will make you aware that a creature succeeded on their check. You may choose to use the Traveller's protection to force a reroll of the dice to take the lower of the two options. If you do so, their check gains the misfortune trait, and the outcome of this new roll is a secret to you. 

Similarly, if you fail an impersonation check against a creature, you are aware of your blunder. The GM will make you aware that you have failed the check, and you may choose to use the Traveller's protection to force a reroll to take the higher of the two options.

## Elves/Drow ((+Elves/Drow))
Tens of thousands of years ago, the elves of the distant continent of Xen’drik rose up against the giants who ruled over them. This rebellion is the defining event in elf history. As the ancient war progressed, the magebreeders of the giants bound magic into the elves who remained loyal to them, forming the drow — assassins bred to prey on their other kin. Ultimately, the elves fled from Xen’drik and settled the island nation of Aerenal, where they split into two distinct cultures: the introspective Aereni and the warlike Tairnadal. Thus, a war nearly forty thousand years ago established the pattern of how elves live today.
)
# Lore Adjustments
- References to the alghollthus should instead be to the giants. The Elves were long ago enslaved to the giants, and only through rebellion did they break free of the giant's control. (Defiance unto death)
- Elves were always a part of the world of Eberron, and have no experience travelling between worlds. Thanks to the great arcane powers of the giants, the Elves still have some remnants of that magic which make certain feats easier for them. (Magic Rider)

## Gnolls ((+Gnolls))
Powerfully-built humanoids that resemble hyenas, gnolls are cunning warriors and hunters. Their frightening visage and efficient tactics have given them an ill-starred reputation.
-
)
Formed from both War and the Wild, gnolls were recruited and bred by both Rak Tulkhesh and the Wild Heart. As foot soldiers of the overlords, they fought against orcs and other early humanoids, as well as battling the gnoll clans of other overlords. Even after the overlords were defeated and bound by the Silver Flame, gnolls continued to be their pawns.

Then, centuries ago, two gnolls from rival clans faced one another on a battlefield soaked in the blood of their kin—then questioned the path that had led them there. The two urged others to deny the voice that called for endless war, to refuse to chase death in the service of a fiend. Two became four, then eight, until entire clans heeded the call. Clan leaders dragged their idols to the place now known as Znir—a word that simply means “stone”—and there, they shattered the images of the fiends they once served. Together, the gathered hunters, shamans, and warriors swore an oath: They might be many clans, but from this day forward, they would be one pack. They would allow no one—not chib, god, or demon—to hold dominion over them. [6]

## You might...
- Always try to work smarter, not harder.
- Be very physically demonstrative—often hugging, punching, or licking your friends.
- Chew through scraps and bones others would throw away.

## Others Probably...
- Are intimidated by your size, teeth, and eerie laugh.
- Assume that you are dishonourable or worse.
- Respect the brutal efficiency of your hunting style.
|
## Physical Description...
A typical gnoll stands over seven feet in height, but this is belied by their hunched posture. Males and females are similar in appearance, and other species have difficulty telling them apart. Gnolls have thick fur over their bodies; depending on clan, this can be uniform in colour or broken up with spots or stripes. Their eyes are yellow or green and gleam with reflected light. While these are common traits, the fiendish heritage of gnolls sometimes manifests itself in its appearance. An unusual gnoll could have glowing red eyes, fur with stripes that glow like flames, or other unusual traits. Typically these don’t grant special abilities, though you could attribute a class ability or feat to such a mutation. [6]

## Society...
The Znir gnolls include a dozen different clans, each of which holds distinct traditions. Once the clans were devoted to different faces of the overlords, but when they shattered their statues, each clan chose one of the moons. All gnolls skillfully hunt and fight, but the Barrakas are known to be the finest trackers of the Pact; the Aryth, the deadliest archers; the Olarune, the strongest warriors and most forceful in the vanguard. Typically, mercenary units are comprised of gnolls of a single clan, assigned based on the nature of the task that lies ahead, and contracts are usually negotiated for a period based on cycles of the clan’s moon.

The clans maintain distinct territories within the Znir region, but all gnolls are welcome around the hearth of any clan; the Znir take pains to crush any tension that arises between the clans. Shamans and leaders from each clan maintain a council at the Znir, around the broken idols. Here they mediate disputes, assign contracts to clans, and allocate funds and equipment. The Eyre clan has honed their skills as smiths and tanners, and they craft much of the equipment used by the Znir gnolls—though there is still a strong tradition of scavenging among the Znir, and warriors often claim trophies from fallen foes.

Gnolls have very strong pack instincts, and an unsentimental, matter-of-fact approach to life, and prioritize results over methods.[7] They instinctively work together in combat and think nothing of placing themselves in harm’s way to protect their kin. If a gnoll character adopts a group of adventurers as their temporary pack, these things apply to the other characters—but the gnoll will be surprised and angry if their non-gnoll packmates don’t show them the same respect. This means the typical gnoll trends towards a Lawful alignment, but good and evil depend on the current terms of their contract. [8]

## Names...
Newborn Gnolls are given a root name, typically that of a bone, plant, or animal (though never Hyena, as this is considered narcissistic and arrogant). As a gnoll reaches certain milestones in life, they add descriptors to their name. Root names are often passed down through families, while descriptors are chosen to fit the gnoll's personality, usually in raucous ceremonies. [7]

### Sample Names
Baobab, Jackal, Onyx Elephant in Shadows, Red Thorn, Unbent Iron Reed, White Acacia, Wistful Tooth, Woodpecker

  
# Gnoll Statistics
Gnolls gameplay statistics, heritages, and additional feats are provided by the Pathfinder 2e Mwangi Expanse book. The following Heritages and feats should be considered an additional pool to pick from in addition to the Pathfinder 2e information already provided.
  
# Gnoll Heritages
You can select once of the following heritage at 1st level to reflect abilities that representative of the training and development you recieved while you were raised in a specific clan. These skills and abilities are specialties of your clan, passed down to you from your ancestors. You have only one heritage and can’t change it later. While you must belong to that clan if you pick one of these heritages, any base pathfinder 2e heritages can belong to any clan. The base heritages are not limited to any particular clan, though some clans might have more or fewer members from a particular base heritage. The pathfinder 2e heritages do not count for clan heritage requirements. 

## Aryth Clan
Your clan is tied to the moon Aryth - the Gateway. Considered the best Archers of the Znir gnolls, you become trained in Simple and Martial ranged weapons. Advanced gnoll weapons count as martial weapons for you.
|
## Barrakas Clan
Your clan is tied to the moon Barrakas - the Lantern. Considered the best trackers of the Znir pact, you gain a special sense: imprecise scent with a range of 30 feet. This means you can use your sense of smell to determine the location of a creature, but it remains hidden. In addition, you become trained in survival and you gain a +1 circumstance bonus to Survival checks to Track creatures that you have previously sensed with your scent. 

## Dravago Clan

## Eyre Clan
Your clan is tied to the moon Eyre - the Anvil. You become trained in Crafting (or another skill if you were already trained in Crafting), and you gain the Quick Repair skill feat. In addition, if you roll a Critical Failure on a Repair check, you get a failure instead.

## Lharvion Clan
Your clan is tied to the moon Lharvion - the Eye. Your clan has unnatural insights and experience with the otherworldly. You become trained in Occultism (or another skill if you were already trained in Occultism) and gain the Root Magic skill feat. When crafting Root Magic talismans you are always able to produce one for yourself, in addition to one which you give to one ally (excluding yourself).

Your clan is tied to the moon Nymm - the Crown. Your clan specializes in leadership in battle, and the ability to direct allies simultaneously. You gain access to the Bark Orders action.

item(
# Bark Orders :a:
-
; auditory, gnoll, linguistic
**Frequency** once per day

You can command your allies to reposition. Any allies who hear and understand this order can use a reaction to Step. Any ally who uses their reaction then becomes immune to bark orders for 10 minutes.
)

-
You are trained to hold the line against any charge. You may take cover behind the shield, gaining the higher bonus for the tower shield.
)

## Rhaan Clan
Your clan is tied to the moon Rhaan - the Book. The Rhaan clan maintains the history of the clans through story and song, and you have a deeper connection to the Primal energies of the world. Choose one cantrip from the primal spell list. You can cast this spell as a primal innate spell at will. A cantrip is heightened to a spell level equal to half your level rounded up. You can change this cantrip to a different one from the same list once per day by meditating and connecting to the Primal energies of Eberron; this is a 10-minute activity that has the concentrate trait.

## Sypheros Clan
Your clan is tied to the moon Sypheros - the Shadow. You have a natural resilience to the dark manifestations of the world. You gain negative resistance equal to half your level (minimum 1). You also have Darkvision instead of Low-Light vision.

## Therendor Clan
Your clan is tied to the moon Therendor - The Healer's Moon. You become trained in Medicine (or another skill if you were already trained in Medicine), and you gain the Battle Medicine skill feat. In addition, when you roll a medicine check to Administer First Aid a critical failure becomes a failure, and a failure becomes a success. 

## Vult Clan
Your clan is tied to the moon Vult - the Warding Moon. You gain the Armor Proficiency general feat. In addition, you may cast the Shield cantrip as an innate occult spell at will. A cantrip is heightened to a spell level equal to half your level rounded up.
|
## Zarantyr Clan
Your clan is tied to the moon Zarantyr - the Storm. You can take advantage of the chaos of battle, ripping and tearing through the enemy. You gain the Rampage reaction.

item(
# Rampage :r:
-
; Gnoll
**Frequency** Once per day

**Trigger** You reduce a creature to 0 hp.
-
You take advantage of the opening. You may spend your reaction to step, stride half your speed, or make a strike.
) 
  
    
note(
The Znir pact typically deploys entire mercenary groups composed of one or two clans for a contract, depending on the nature of the mission. 

Aryth, Barrakas, and Rhaan are typically involved in scouting.
Dravago is typically deployed to any northern engagements.
Eyre, Nymm, and Therendor are typically deployed to support other clans or participate in coalition forces.
Lharvion and Sypheros are typically deployed to anything involving the potential for extraplanar contact, or the undead.
Olarune, Vult, and Zarantyr are typically deployed to where heavy fighting is expected.

Although these are the specialities of each of the clans, all clans are expected to be able to perform in any context.

)
=
item(
# Essence of the Moon
## Feat 5
-
; Gnoll
**Prerequisites** clan heritage  
-
Your connection to the tribe and your moon is strong. You gain the bonus associated with your clan. 

**Aryth** With keen eyes, your shots land true. You may ignore the penalty for targetting a creature in the second range increment of your ranged weapons, and the volley trait of your weapons is reduced by 15 feet.

**Barrakas** The range of your imprecise smell sense is increased to 60 feet. In addition, when you track creatures that you have previously sensed with your scent you gain a +2 circumstance bonus.

**Dravago** You gain Terrain Expertise in the arctic (or a different terrain if you have the arctic already) and become trained in survival (or expert if you are already trained).

**Eyre** You can repair damaged weapons and armour on the field, and return companions to the fight swiftly. You gain a +1 circumstance bonus to Crafting checks to repair items, and you don’t need a repair kit for non-magical item repairs as long as you have any amount of junk, spare parts, or debris at your disposal. The gear you are repairing can be worn for the duration of the repair, but the wearer cannot do anything without interrupting the repair.

**Lharvion** Once per day, you can cast Protection. At 7th level, the spell is heightened to 2nd level, and every 2 levels thereafter, the spell is heightened an additional spell level.

**Nymm** The frequency of bark orders becomes once per hour instead. Additionally, you may instead single out an ally to use their reaction to make a strike.

**Olarune** The frequency of Rapid Cover becomes once per hour instead. In addition, when you use the shield block reaction you have resistance 10 to any damage over the shield's hardness.

**Rhaan** Your connection to the primal energies of Eberron lets you reach the fey more easily. You gain the Summon Fey primal spell which you can cast once per day.

**Sypheros** The DC of your recovery checks is equal to 9 + your dying value, or 8 + your dying value if you have the Toughness general feat. In addition, whenever someone returns you to life using magic that would normally leave you debilitated for a week (such as raise dead or the resurrect ritual), you don't suffer that condition.

**Therendor** With experience performing first aid in adverse conditions, hostile environments do not increase the difficulty of your Treat Wounds checks. In addition, when you make a Treat Wounds check the healing dice are increased to d10s, and if you roll a critical failure it becomes a failure instead.

=
#### 13th Level
item(
# Moon Presence
## Feat 13
-
; Gnoll
**Prerequisites** clan heritage  
-
By the clan and the pact your powers are heightened, and your senses keen. You channel a connection to your clan that few have ever been able to achieve. You gain the bonus depending on your original clan. Gnoll of many tribes does not count for this feat.

**Aryth** The impact of your ranged weapons is aided by your precision. Once per turn, you gain a circumstance bonus to your ranged attack damage rolls equal to the number of weapon damage dice.

**Barrakas** Your scent sense becomes a precise sense. Creatures under the effects of magic that would hide their passing or presence find it foiled by your keen smell unless accounted for. If you make a survival check to track a creature under the effects of Pass Without Trace, the DC has a -4 circumstance penalty (no lower than their regular survival DC).

**Dravago** You gain the Terrain Stalker feat for snow and can move up to half your speed without attempting a Stealth check. In addition, you can translate your experience with the difficult terrain of the arctic to anywhere. Creatures in difficult terrain are flat-footed to you.

**Eyre** You can sharpen weapons, polish armour, and apply special techniques to temporarily gain better effects from your armaments. By spending 1 hour working on a weapon or armour, you can grant it the effects of a +1 potency rune until your next daily preparations, gaining a +1 item bonus to attack rolls for a weapon or increasing armour’s item bonus to AC by 1. Once per day, you may choose one of these items to gain a bonus of 2 instead. This has no effect if the weapon or armour already had a potency rune.

**Lharvion** Aberrations of the world are the speciality of your clan, and in particular, the series of blows to best fell one. You become trained in Aberration lore. In addition, if you succeed on a strike against an Aberration, it becomes flat-footed to you until the start of your next turn.

**Nymm** Leadership is what keeps the Znir strong, and you have trained to maximize the potential of yourself and your allies. When you are adjacent to at least one ally, you and adjacent allies gain a +1 circumstance bonus to AC and saving throws. This bonus increases to +2 to Reflex saves against area effects.

**Olarune** You no longer need to take cover to gain the higher bonus from tower shields, instead, you always have the higher bonus. In addition, with your great strength, you can wield tower shields beyond what any other mortal could carry. Anyone may craft tower shields out of any precious material, but only you may wield them due to their great bulk. When crafting a tower shield out of a precious material that is not darkwood, you must have the equivalent value in darkwood (up to the maximum price of the shield). For instance, crafting a standard-grade adamantine tower shield is a total cost of 440 GP with at least 55 GP of adamantine and 55 GP of darkwood.

**Rhaan** The tricks of the fey have become part of your repertoire. You can cast haste and slow as primal innate spells once per day. At 17th level, these are heightened to 7th level.

**Sypheros** The realm of the dead grants you a pathway to many abilities some consider to be unnatural. You can save others from death, and also yourself. The DC of your recovery checks is to 8 + your dying value, or 7 + your dying value if you have the Toughness general feat. In addition, once per day you can cast death ward as an occult innate spell. 

**Therendor** Your healing abilities channelled by the power of the moon can bring back those others could not. If a creature has died of mortal wounds within the last minute, you may attempt an Administer First Aid check. On a critical success, the creature is revived, loses the dying condition (but remains unconscious), and becomes drained 1 for 1 week. This check can not overcome extraordinary circumstances, such as diseases, curses, or massive damage to the body. After you attempt this special check, the creature becomes immune to it for a week.

**Vult** You can ward off even the eyes that would follow your movements. You gain nondetection as an innate occult spell once per day, which can only be cast on yourself and is automatically heightened to half your level rounded up.

**Zarantyr** Rip and tear until it is done, there is no frequency on rampage, but it gains the flourish trait.

## Kalashtar ((+Kalashtar))
Kalashtar are born with a bond to an otherworldly being. They have memories of lives never lived, visions of combat with fiends that they never fought, and the sense of an endless struggle against darkness. For all the pain and suffering in the world, the Kalashtar know that there is a path to light.  Some faceless enemies would hunt all the Kalashtar down and would see their bloodlines eradicated. The Kalashtar's path to light is a dangerous one, as death awaits in the shadows.
-
)
The kalashtar are a compound people, created from the union of humanity and renegade spirits from the plane of dreams — spirits called quori. Kalashtar are often seen as wise, spiritual people with great compassion for others. There is an unmistakable alien quality to the kalashtar, though, as they are haunted by the conflicts of their otherworldly spirits.

Every kalashtar has a connection to a spirit of light, a bond shared by other members of their bloodline. Kalashtar can’t directly communicate with their quori spirits. Rather, they might experience this relationship as a sense of instinct and inspiration, drawing on the memories of the spirit when they dream. This connection grants kalashtar minor psionic abilities, as well as protection from psychic attacks. All of these quori dream spirits are virtuous, but some are warriors and others are more contemplative. Typically, a kalashtar knows the name and nature of their spirit, but some may know nothing of their spirit or the source of their psychic gifts, such as an orphan kalashtar raised among strangers. [7]

## You might...
- Try to understand the motives and feelings of your allies, and even your enemies.
- Encourage others to dream a little bigger, and set lofty goals to achieve. 
- Apply dream logic to mundane situations.

## Others Probably...
- Think you're human, though you move and act in a slightly otherworldly way.
- Find themselves drawn to the wisdom you display, which seems beyond your years.
- Opening their emotions to you, even before they realize they are doing so.

## Physical Description...
Kalashtar appear human, but their spiritual connection affects them in a variety of ways. Kalashtar have symmetrical, slightly angular features, and their eyes often glow when they are focused or expressing strong emotions. [7]
|
## Society...
There are three main kalashtar societies. 

The Adaran kalashtar were born in Sarlona, in the distant land of Adar. Today, the Empire of Riedra dominates Sarlona, and imperial forces endlessly siege Adar. The monks and priests of Adar believe that the war against the Inspired and il-Lashtavar won’t be won with weapons; instead, prayer and guided meditation will ultimately shift the balance from darkness to light. Adaran kalashtar rarely take direct action without reason. Adaran kalashtar are ascetic, disciplined, and focused on the Path of Light. They are taught to inspire those who live in fear and enlighten those lost to darkness.

The khorvairian kalashtar exist in communities of several major cities of the Five Nations, including the Overlook district in Sharn and Whitewalls in Fairhaven. They prefer to stay close to one another, both to practice their shared traditions and to stand together against any threats posed by the Dreaming Dark. They are familiar with the Path of Light and other kalashtar customs. But there’s no Riedran army at the gates; they know the Dreaming Dark is a threat, but it’s a ghost in the shadows. These kalashtar simply seek to spread light through their daily actions, such as showing kindness and compassion or mediating disputes. 
On the other hand, some of the kalashtar of Khorvaire have embraced a grim path in the battle against darkness. The Shadow Watchers don’t believe that evil can be fought merely with kindness and prayer. Members of this order seek to identify sources of corruption and ruthlessly eliminate them. While a Shadow Watcher’s focus is on agents of the Dreaming Dark, they can pursue any force of evil, supernatural or otherwise. [8]

)

## Alignment and Religion...
While kalashtar can be evil - the communities they are raised in and the light quori that has selected them inclines them towards good. However lofty their goals are, they will achieve their motivations in any number of ways, neither law nor chaos has strong sway over the kalashtar.

Most kalashtar are devoted to the Path of Light, and though its faithful worship no gods, the faith itself can be a source of divine magic.

## Names...
A kalashtar name adds a personal prefix to the name of the quori spirit within the kalashtar. Such names have no relation to the kalashtar’s gender.

Kalashtar orphans are unlikely to know the name of their spirit and take names from another source.

# Kalashtar Heritages
The abilities and the personalities of kalashtar are heavily influenced by their quori spirit. Choose one of the following kalashtar heritages at 1st level.

## Du'ulora Kalashtar
The fiendish du'ulora spirit drives your rage and aggression. How you channel this spirit's energy in your daily life is up to you, but you have developed the ability to unleash it on your enemies. You gain the Phantom Pain spell which you can cast as an occult innate spell once per day.

**Special** If at any point you gain access to the Moment of Clarity feat through class or archetype, you automatically gain it from this heritage.

## Hashalaq Kalashtar
The hashalaq quori is a force that feeds on doubt and desire. You can choose one of the following paths. 
### Hashalaq Seducer
You become trained in Diplomacy (or another skill if you were already trained in Diplomacy). You gain the Group Impression skill feat. In addition, when you make a group impression you can increase the number of targets by half rounded up.
### Hashalaq Insightful
You become trained in Deception (or another skill if you were already trained in Deception). You gain the Lie to Me skill feat. In addition, you gain a +2 circumstance bonus against any attempt to lie to you.
### Hashalaq Deciever 
You become trained in Deception (or another skill if you were already trained in Deception). You gain the Charming Liar skill feat. In addition, you gain a +1 circumstance bonus to your deception checks.
## Kalaraq Kalashtar
Kalaraq are the natural leaders of the quori, spirits of pride and ambition. Though rarest of the kalashtar spiritual lineages, you depend on your allies as they depend on you. You become trained in Diplomacy (or another skill if you were already trained in Diplomacy). 

If you are using the stamina variant rules, you gain the Encouraging Words skill feat (even without meeting the level prerequisites) and a +1 circumstance bonus when you use the feat.

Otherwise, you gain the following action.
item(
# Encouraging Words
## Feat 1
-
; Auditory, Kalashtar, Linguistic, Mental, Skill
**Requirements** The target ally lost hp within the last round
-
You give an ally within 30 feet a quick pep talk, helping them recover. Attempt a Diplomacy check. The DC is usually the same as a treat wounds check, though the GM might adjust it based on the circumstances. If you have expert proficiency in Diplomacy, you can instead attempt a DC 20 check to increase the Temporary Hit Points recovered by 5; if you have master proficiency, you can attempt a DC 30 check to increase the Temporary Hit Points by 15; if you have legendary proficiency, you can attempt a DC 40 check to increase the Temporary Hit Points by 25.   

No matter the result, the ally is temporarily immune to your Encouraging Words for 1 hour.

**Critical Success** The ally gains 2d8 Temporary Hit Points.

**Success** The ally gains 1d8 Temporary Hit Points.

**Critical Failure** Your words fall flat, the ally is temporarily immune to Encouraging Words for 1 day.

**Special** The Temporary Hit Points gained through this action can never add up to be greater than the total Hit Points that a creature has lost. If the recipient receives additional healing, the temporary hit points from this source are reduced by an equal amount to maintain this balance.
)

note(
# The Stamina System

Encouraging Words is designed for the stamina system. Keep in mind if you are not using the stamina system, that this feat is an approximation of it. Encouraging Words intends to allow you to keep your allies in the fight longer, but without providing a bonus beyond that. It should not allow "overhealing" as other sources of temporary hit points might allow.

For example, if your ally has 10 maximum hp and has taken 5 damage: if you succeed on your Encouraging words and roll 8 on 1d8 for temporary hit points, that ally gains 5 temporary hit points. This brings them "back to their maximum hit points", even though some of it is temporary. If they receive 3 points of regular healing after this, they lose 3 temporary hit points as well, maintaining their total of 10. As a result, it is possible to lose all the temporary hit points to healing.
)

## Tsucora Kalashtar
The tsucora are the quori of classic nightmares, feeding on terror. You become trained in intimidation (or another skill if you were already trained in intimidation) and gain the Intimidating Glare feat. When you use the Demoralize action, you can instead project nightmares into the target's mind. If you do so, Demoralize gains the mental trait rather than the visual trait.

Dragonmarked focus items 
limit ritual focus spells to dragonmarks?**

Dragonmarks are unique in that they provide arcane specialization in one specific area, and only that narrow area. Since it is possible to have focus points from multiple sources, any source that provides focus points with the Dragonmark trait cannot be combined with any focus point sources that do not have the Dragonmark trait. The reverse is also true. Dragonmark focus points should effectively be considered their own pool, with their own proficiency rank for spell attack rolls and spell DCs.  All Dragonmark focus spells are considered to be of the Arcane tradition.

Otherwise, focus provided by Dragonmarks follow the all the rules for focus spells, including heightening and refocusing.

**Heightened (2nd)** When the spell ends, the target doesn't necessarily realize it was charmed unless its friendship with you or the actions you convinced it to take clash with its expectations, meaning you could potentially convince the target to maintain its attitude via mundane means.

**Heightened (3th)** If the target fails its save, its Attitude increases to a minimum of indifferent.

**Heightened (5th)** If the target fails its save, its Attitude increases to a minimum of friendly.

## Weapon Traits

  **Drow:** Drow craft and use these weapons.
  **Gnoll:** The Znir consider these weapons to be a signature weapon of their pact and don’t sell them to outsiders. The only way to acquire a gnoll weapon is to be given one or to take it from a fallen foe.
  **Returning:** When you make a thrown attack with this weapon and roll a failure, the weapon returns to you if you have a free hand.

## Critical Specialization Effects

    **Boomerang:** Choose one creature other than the initial target within the first range increment of you. If its AC is lower than your attack roll result for the critical hit, you deal damage to that creature equal to the result of the weapon damage die you rolled (including extra dice for its potency rune, if any). This amount isn't doubled, and no bonuses or other additional dice apply to this damage.

## Weapon Descriptions
  **Boomerang, Talenta:** The halflings of the Talenta Plains use traditional boomerangs - simple curved, polished sticks designed to return to the thrower.
  **Boomerang, Xen'drik:** The drow of Xen'drik use three-pronged boomerangs to hunt prey. Some adventurers and explorers learn to use the weapon while operating in the Xen'drik jungles, but few outside the drow communities ever master the intricacies of the Xen'drik boomerang.
  **Double-Bladed Scimitar:** The Double-Bladed Scimitar the signature weapon of Valenar elves. A haft of fine wood supports a long, curving blade on either end. Forged with techniques honed over centuries, these blades are strong, sharp, and remarkably light. Each scimitar is a masterpiece, and as a result the double-bladed scimitar is an expensive weapon (10 gp) — few though ever have the opportunity to purchase one. A Valenar blade in the hands of a non-elf is generally assumed to have been stolen or looted from a fallen foe, and a Valenar elf might feel entitled to demand its return or challenge the bearer to prove they’re worthy to wield it.
  **Great bow** Despite its name - the great bow is not significantly larger than a normal longbow. However, the draw of the weapon is deceptively heavy. Great bows are made from horn, a darkwood core, and sinew laminated together to increase the power of its pull and the force of its projectile. This allows the bow to fire larger projectiles significantly faster, resulting in greater penetrating power. You must have at least 14 strength and use two hands to fire it, and it cannot be used while mounted. Any time an ability is specifically restricted to a longbow, such as Erastil’s favoured weapon, it also applies to great bows unless otherwise stated. To craft a great bow, you must have at least 5sp worth of darkwood to form the core of the weapon. 
  **Myrnaxe** As mercenaries in a land of monsters, the Znir gnolls prepare to face a wide range of exotic opponents. With this in mind, the Eyre clan produces a weapon they call the myrnaxe, named for the smith who created it. A myrnaxe has a sturdy wooden haft with a curved axe blade on one end and a long spearhead on the other. Functionally, a myrnaxe is a battleaxe, but it can be used to inflict either slashing damage (with the axe blade) or piercing damage (with the spear).
  It’s common for each head to be made of a different metal, so the spearhead might be silver while the axe blade is made of byeshk—thus maximizing its versatility against multiple foes. When crafting a myrnaxe, you may choose to make each side out of a different material. If you do so, the myrnaxe item uses highest cost and level between the two precious materials. You must have half the normal cost of each precious material to be used, and both sides of the weapon gain the effect of its respective precious material.

  **Sharrash:** 
  **Tangat:** The Tangat, developed by the halflings of the Talenta Plains, features a curved blade (like a scimitar's) mounted on a short haft.

## Armor Descriptions

    **Darkleaf:** Similar to leafweave armor, darkleaf armor is made of carefully cured and beautifully carved pieces of wood, suppliemented by alchemically treated leaves from the darkwood tree. 
    **Leafweave:** The artisans of Aerenal weave suits of armor from bronzewood laves, which are then treated by a special alchemical process that makes them as tough and flexible as leather.

-
; Consumable, Magical, Trap
**Usage** held in 1 hand, see details; **Bulk** 1

**Price** 15 gp
-
A blast disk holds destructive arcane power. A typical blast disk is about nine inches in diameter and one inch thick, made from layers of different metal; dragonshards are embedded in the surface of the disk and arcane symbols are engraved in its surface.

**Trigger** After activating the item, the trigger immediately comes into play. You can also choose to ignore the trigger and immediately activate the payload.
**Time** When the disk is activated, the user can set a time delay of up to 10 minutes before it releases its effect.
**Proximity** 30 seconds after the disk is activated, it can trigger when someone comes within a certain distance of the disk or when someone first makes contact with the disk, then breaks that contact.
**Impact** The activated disk can be set to detonate on impact, then used by throwing or dropping it.  

**Payload** When the blast disk is triggered, it produces one of the following magical effects, chosen when it was manufactured:
**Explosive** The creates an explosion in a 20-foot burst centered on the disk. Each creature in the area must make a DC 18 basic reflex save, dealing 6d6 fire damage. Explosive blast disk damage ignores up to 10 hardness of objects and structures. Unattended objects and structures automatically critically fail the reflex save.
**Spell** While crafting this item, if a Spell of a lower level than the item is cast into it, you may instead store the effects of the spell in the disk. The stored spell must take 3 actions or fewer to cast, have a hostile effect, and target one creature or have an area. 
Once a spell is stored in the disk, the disk gains all the traits of that spell. If the stored spell targets one or more creatures, it targets the creature that set off the glyph. If it has an area, that area is centered on the creature that set off the glyph. The disk counts as a magical trap, using your spell DC for both the Perception check to notice it and the Thievery check to disable it; both checks require the creature attempting them to be trained in order to succeed.

### Dragonmark Focus Items ((+Dragonmark Focus Items))
)
## Dragonmark focus items
Much of the influence of the dragonmarked houses is based on a simple principle: it’s easier to amplify an existing magical effect, such as that of a dragonmark, than to create the same effect from nothing. Taken on their own, the powers granted by dragonmarks aren’t overwhelmingly powerful. However, over the course of centuries, House Cannith and the Twelve have developed items that focus and enhance the powers of the mark to produce powerful, reliable effects. In many cases—such as the storm spires of House Lyrandar and the creation forges of House Cannith—the Arcane Congress has been unable to duplicate the effects of these powerful focus items for non-dragonmarked creatures. Other items have since been reproduced in forms that anyone can use, but an item that requires the user to possess a specific dragonmark is always easier to create and less expensive than one that produces the same effect for anyone, giving the dragonmarked houses an important advantage.

Dragonmark focus items are rarely sold in stores. They can only be created using proprietary tools, and are produced exclusively by House Cannith and the Twelve for use by trusted agents of the dragonmarked houses. So while many Medani inquisitives wear Medi spectacles, they acquired them through service to the house, not by purchasing them with gold. While a dragonmark focus item usually has the same general appearance as the item whose effects it duplicates, it bears the image of the required mark somewhere on the item, and often carries the sigil of the associated house. Siberys dragonshards are a vital component of focus items, most including a shard in some form. With that said, a focus item’s design can differ from the usual magic item’s form—the serpentine mirror has a similar effect to a crystal ball, but it’s a flat mirror as opposed to an orb.

The following items are Dragonmark focus items. They function identically to the duplicated item, however their level is reduced by 1. The price, but no other statistics are similarly reduced to the new level. All these items gain the Invested, and Dragonmark trait. You may only invest in the item if you have the requisite dragonmark.

The dragonmarked houses form the foundation of Khorvaire’s magical economy, and they’re the source of many of the magic items you can buy in the Five Nations. 90% of potions of healing are either made by House Jorasco or produced according to their specifications. If you have two +1 shortswords produced by a Cannith forge, they’ll be essentially identical, while an Aereni shortsword would be lovingly crafted by a particular artisan.In dealing with house products, consider whether the item is military or civilian in nature. During the war, a large portion of House Cannith’s manufactured goods were designed for military use. If you buy a cloak of protection from a Cannith dealer in Sharn, is it an elegant model made for a noble to wear to the Tain Gala, or is it a Brelish Bear cloak, originally issued to an elite commando? If an item is essentially a tool of war, then it may have actually been used in the war; if so, which nation was it made for? Is it legitimate surplus? Was it likely sold by a retired soldier, or salvaged from a battlefield?Military gear is often more functional than decorative. It may bear the markings of a particular nation, and it’s possible it shows signs of use. On the other hand, civilian products need to lure in customers. Consider a potion of healing. The potions Jorasco sold to the Brelish army were known as “coppers” because of the coppery taste of the fluid, and the potency is clearly marked for accurate administration; a Brelish soldier might call a superior potion of healing a “copper-3.” By contrast, a civilian potion of healing could be called something like “Vivacity,” with a shiny label and available in a variety of flavors. You might find a barker in a part of town where the people are wealthy enough to buy such a product. “Feeling worn down? Perhaps you’ve had a little fall? Get back on your feet with a shot of Vivacity!”

**Usage** -; **Bulk** -

**Price** 5 gp

TODO
A final messenger is a tiny homunculus—a delicate winged creature designed to facilitate communication between warforged soldiers during the Last War. If you are a warforged, you can invest in the Final Messenger item to hold a final messenger and integrate it into your body. While it is part of your body, the messenger cannot be targeted by any attack. You can only have one messenger attached to your body at a time.
A final messenger holds four pieces of data, accessible only to the warforged it is attached to:
- A destination for the messenger. This can be very specific (a particular apartment in Sharn) or more general (an open marketplace).
- A target individual. This could be a specific person or a category (“Any Karrnathi warforged”).
- A single image recorded through the eyes of a warforged attached to the messenger.
-A message of up to 25 words.While the messenger is attached to you, you can use an action to review the data currently stored within the final messenger, and if you choose, to change any or all of these data points.

You can release the final messenger as an action, at which point it flies to its destination by the most direct route possible. Once it reaches the destination it seeks the target individual; if no target has been set, it approaches the nearest warforged. If you are reduced to 0 hit points while a final messenger is attached to you, it immediately detaches and seek out its target. It retains its stored message, but replaces its stored image with the last thing you saw before dropping to zero hit points. A final messenger uses the Homunculus stat block, but loses the Master Link, and all attacks. It gains the Mindless trait adjusting to Int -5, Wis 0, and Cha -5.

A messenger can only remain active for 8 hours after it detaches from a warforged body, after which time its energy dissipates and it falls unconscious. An unconscious messenger must complete 8 hours attached to a warforged, after which it regains its energy, as well as regaining all lost hit points.

# Byeshk
## Material 2+
-
;Precious
Byeshk is a rare and heavy metal of lustrous purple, mined from the Byeshk and Graywall Mountains along Droaam’s borders. It can also be found in the Ironlands, a Khyberian demiplane that’s been delved into by the Ghaash’kala and Kech Sharaat. Aberrations tied to the daelkyr—including dolgaunts, dolgrims, and mind flayers—are susceptible to weapons made of byeshk alloys, making the metal highly valued to the Dhakaani, Gatekeepers druids, and others that fight aberrations. Dhakaani weapons forged during the Xoriat Incursion were often forged from byeshk.

**Price** 3800 gp

**Usage** held in 1 hand; **Bulk** L
-
These infamous +2 greater striking daggers, prized by assassins, have a Khyber dragonshard embedded into the pommel that channels the souls of victims, but doesn’t itself trap them. There’s much debate over the actual fate of the souls of those slain by a Keeper’s Fang. Common myth says that the souls of victims are trapped in the Lair of the Keeper, and heroes can seek to reclaim a soul from the Sovereign of Death and Decay. Another myth maintains that these weapons channel souls to the overlord Katashka, and that one must deal with the Lords of Dust to restore a victim. Most Keeper’s Fangs were created by the Shaarat’khesh assassins of the Empire of Dhakaan. Rather than ascribing the blade’s power to the Keeper--whose existence the Dhakaani reject--they believe these blades utterly destroy the souls of their victims.
**Activate** :r:; **Frequency** once per day; **Trigger** You reduce a creature to 0 hit points with a strike from this blade' **Effect** the creature is slain and its soul removed. A creature whose soul has been stolen in this way can be restored to life only by means of a wish spell.

The chot’uul monks, who guard the dreams of Dhakaan, craft objects that are drawn to Dal Quor with a dreamer. When you dream, your kra’uul objects accompany you. The physical object remains with your body in Eberron, but the idea of it travels with you and you can use it while exploring Dal Quor. 
While the techniques of crafting kra’uul objects are known only to the chot’uul, your GM can introduce other dreambound objects. A cursed sword might follow its bearer even into dreams, while a powerful artifact could be even more glorious when seen in Dal Quor.
The process of creating a Dreambound Item is the same as creating the base item. You must know the crafting recipe for Kra’uul items, and if you create a dreambound item the base price is increased by 10%.

## Magewrights
The magical economy of Eberron is built on the backs of the magewrights: spellcasters who know a handful of cantrips or rituals that allow them to provide vital services. Wizards are exceptional; their ability to prepare any spell with a few hours of study reflects remarkable talent and versatility. By contrast, a magewright knows few spells, but because of their intense focus on those spells, they’re able to cast them in ways others cannot.
An artificer is equally exceptional. Most of the people assembling magic items at Cannith forgeholds aren’t artificers; they work using industrialized processes, massive tools that enhance the creation process (like the creation forge), and house resources. These craftspeople couldn’t just create a wand at home alone. By contrast, as an artificer, you are unconventional, using personalized techniques and improvising solutions. 
Just because you can create any common magic item with little time and effort doesn’t mean that this is typical or that others could duplicate your work. Never forget that in Eberron, player characters are exceptional. Even at low levels, you have potential that the common magewright can’t match. There are also exceptional NPCs, ones who can do things player characters cannot; but remember that as a player character, not everyone who follows your path can match your abilities.
