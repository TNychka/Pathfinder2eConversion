# Dragonmarked Houses ((Dragonmarked Houses))
As individual families manifested dragonmarks, each joined together with other families of alike marks to form houses. These houses grew, and have become powerful dragonmarked dynasties. With improved abilities due to their dragonmarked powers, and complete control over their bloodlines and commercial use of their dragonmark, these houses now compose some of the most powerful factions in Eberron - on par with that of many nations.

## Reputation System
If you are using the reputation subsystem, PCs with connections to the house start with a +5 reputation. Excoriates start with a -5 reputation, or potentially worse. The level of reputation someone has with a house may influence their access to the house's resources, or even their business altogether.

It is for this reason many nations are very careful to avoid incurring the houses' wrath. To be cut off from Cannith manufacturing, or Jorasco healing would be a significant blow to any nation.

# Favoured in House
## Feat 3
-
; Uncommon, Dragonmarked Heritage, General
**Prerequisite** your house is friendly or helpful to you.
-
You have begun to develop popularity and connections within your house, and you can use these connections to fast track your requests from the house. When you make a request of your house, it may be to any house member whether they know you or not, as long as they are at least indifferent towards you. For any request for a favour that the house performs such acquiring important information, introductions to important people, or the loan of equipment or personnel, you gain a +1 circumstance bonus. A lesser mark grants you a +2 circumstance bonus, a greater mark grants you a +3 circumstance bonus, and a siberys mark grants you a +4 circumstance bonus. The GM sets the DC based on the scope of the favour being requested - highly dangerous, expensive, or illegal favours take a -4 circumstance penalty. See Dragonmarked Houses for some examples of favours that a house might be able to provide.
)

note(
# GM Adjudication
Whenever a character takes the favoured in House feat, especially in the middle of an ongoing campaign, an explanation is required. If a character has been a constant embarassment to their house, opinions won’t suddenly change because they went up a level and gained a feat slot. This is a prerequisite of the feat: It needs to be justified, and a GM is free to refuse the request. 

# Losing your favour
Whether by excoration, or actions that have tarnished the reputation of your house, in the event of extrodinary circumstances you might lose the favour of your house. Until you regain the favour of your house, you lose access to any of the benefits granted by the Favoured in House feat. If reconsiliation with the house is not something you desire, you may retrain out of this feat for free with a week of downtime as normal.
)

## Dragonmarked Economy
Dragonmarked houses are the backbone of the economies of Khorvaire. As a result, it's nearly impossible to avoid dealing with a house during your adventuring career. For things such as Armour, Weapons, Services, or Transportation, a dragonmarked house will likely be involved.

# House Cannith ((+House Cannith))
House Cannith has risen to dominate commerce and industry in Khorvaire. For every advance made in magic, odds are good that Cannith had a hand in it—from everbright lanterns to the lightning rail, from the warforged to the secret experiments now lost deep within the wastes of the Mournland.
-
)
With its power and creative genius, the House Cannith commands both respect and fear. Despite its accomplishments, however, Cannith stands in turmoil. Unable to agree on a new ruler in the aftermath of the Day of Mourning, the house splintered into three factions, each with its own agenda. This rift has caused unease among the houses and beyond, giving monarchs and entrepreneurs pause even as they cautiously back one of three would-be leaders.

## Services
In addition to any regular services that House Cannith might provide, such as appropriate services from the core rule book pg 294, Cannith provides the following additional benefits.

Tinkerer or Fabricator's guild
- will purcase Uncommon, Rare, and Unique items at 65% of Price.
- will cast any mark of Making Focus Spells at a 10% discount of the spellcasting services table 6-15 in the core rulebook.
- Tinkerer's guild approved manufacturers can repair any common item of 5th level or lower, or any non-magical item below 10th level for 5% of the item's value.

## Membership
Membership in House Cannith is primarily by blood, though more than a few members have entered through marriage. After the mourning, House Cannith was split into three factions. Cannith East, Cannith West, and Cannith South. When you gain membership with the house, you must pick one of these three factions.

## Benefits of House Cannith
If you are a member of House Cannith in good standing, you have access to the following benefits with your faction. 

**Economics:**  House  Cannith  covets  magic  items,  especially  those  of  Cyre  and  Xen’drik.  Members  who 
find such items are strongly encouraged to bring them to the house, which then researches them or loans them 
to those on house assignments. Items are evaluated, and the member who found them is paid 65% of the estimated worth. In addition, Cannith South will subsidize up to one-half the total cost of house expeditions to Xen’drik or Cyre, as long as such expeditions leave from Sharn and include at least one Cannith South member. 

**Gear:**  Members  of  House  Cannith  are  always  well  outfitted—anything less would be an affront to the house’s pride. Those on Cannith business are fully outfitted with mundane equipment, and those on personal business pay only 25% of the standard cost for mundane gear. 

**Information:** Members can have magic items identified for 50% of the normal cost and get access to maps and reports from Cannith explorers in Cyre and Xen’drik.

**Access:** Only members of the house and their associates have access to the house’s forges and workshops.

## favoured in House Benefits
Though all members of House Cannith have a level of privilege, the split in the house has led to ill will between competing factions. Requests from members of Cannith East might be ignored by Cannith South unless the southern  faction feels generous or will profit in some way. A party from Cannith West can ask for a warforged bodyguard from Cannith South, but have less chance of receiving them than a party affiliated with Merrix. The following table indicates the types of favours a Cannith character with the favoured in House feat might request. In addition to general favours, each arm of the house can provide special favours, mainly to its members. The following are some examples of potential benefits.

# House Deneith

)
From its beginnings as an order of mercenaries and soldiers to its modern incarnation as the human face of law and battle, House Deneith has maintained its position as the primary force for security and defense in the Five Nations. Though its fortunes rose during the Last War, the services Deneith renders are no less valuable in times 
of peace. Today, the house is as prosperous as ever, with its position of neutrality firmly established and a host of eager clients ready to use its services. This prosperity tells only half the story, however, and Deneith’s past fortunes might not be enough to guarantee the house’s future.
