## Armour Traits
**Primal:** This armour is created entirely out of primal components, and can be considered wooden armour for druid and other anathemas.
## Armour Descriptions
**Darkleaf:** Similar to leafweave armour, darkleaf armour is made of carefully cured and beautifully carved pieces of wood, supplemented by treated leaves. This special process enables the many primal practitioners of the world a sturdy, yet entirely natural armour.

**Leafweave:** The artisans of Aerenal weave suits of armour from leaves and wood, which are then treated by a special process that makes them as tough and flexible as leather. This special process enables the many primal practitioners of the world a sturdy, yet entirely natural armour.

## Weapon Traits
**Dual:** A single dual weapon is balanced such that their flurry of blows land with the speed of two weapons. Dual weapons satisfy requirements of dual-wielding melee weapons, such as for the Ranger Twin Takedown feat.

**Drow:** Drow craft and use these weapons.

**Gnoll:** The Znir consider these weapons to be a signature weapon of their pact and don’t sell them to outsiders. The only way to acquire a gnoll weapon is to be given one or to take it from a fallen foe.

**Returning:** When you make a thrown attack with this weapon and roll a failure, the weapon returns to you if you have a free hand.
|
## Critical Specialization Effects
**Boomerang:** Choose one creature other than the initial target within the first range increment of you. If its AC is lower than your attack roll result for the critical hit, you deal damage to that creature equal to the result of the weapon damage die you rolled (including extra dice for its potency rune, if any). This amount isn't doubled, and no bonuses or other additional dice apply to this damage.
    
## Weapon Descriptions
**Boomerang, Talenta:** The halflings of the Talenta Plains use traditional boomerangs - simple curved, polished sticks designed to return to the thrower.

**Boomerang, Xen'drik:** The drow of Xen'drik use three-pronged bladed boomerangs to hunt prey. Some adventurers and explorers learn to use the weapon while operating in the Xen'drik jungles, but few outside the drow communities ever master the intricacies of the Xen'drik boomerang.

**Double-Bladed Scimitar:** The Double-Bladed Scimitar is the signature weapon of Valenar elves. A haft of fine wood supports a long, curving blade on either end. 

**Gnoll bow:** Though the gnollbow is not significantly larger than a normal longbow, the draw of the weapon is deceptively heavy. Gnoll bows are made from horn, a darkwood core, and sinew laminated together to increase the power of its pull and the force of its projectile. This allows the bow to fire larger projectiles at much higher velocity, resulting in greater penetrating power. However, regular arrows shatter under the force of the bow and only gnoll arrows can be used as ammunition. You must use two hands to fire it, and it cannot be used while mounted. Any time an ability is specifically restricted to a longbow, such as Erastil’s favoured weapon, it also applies to gnoll bows unless otherwise stated. To craft a gnoll bow, you must have at least 5sp worth of darkwood to form the core of the weapon. 
=
**Gnoll Arrows:** These projectiles are the only ammunition that can withstand the force of gnoll bows. The shaft of an arrow is made of darkwood. It is stabilized in flight by fletching at one end and bears a metal head on the other. To craft gnoll arrows, you must have at least 2cp worth of darkwood to form the shaft of the arrow.

**Myrnaxe** As mercenaries in a land of monsters, the Znir gnolls prepare to face a wide range of exotic opponents. A myrnaxe has a sturdy wooden haft with a curved axe blade on one end and a long spearhead on the other. Depending on the wielder's stance, the myrnaxe is either functionally a battleaxe or a spear. A user may switch between the sides of the myrnaxe with an interact action. The myrnaxe has the damage, hands, group, and weapon traits of the side in user. Myrnaxes are composed of two attached items: the Myrnaxe - Axe, and the Myrnaxe - Spearhead. It’s common for each head to be made of a different metal, so the spearhead might be silver while the axe blade is made of byeshk-thus maximizing its versatility against multiple foes. When crafting a myrnaxe, both sides are manufactured at the same time, using their respective crafting costs for material, and forming a completed Myrnaxe when finished. Each side of the weapon gains the effect of its respective precious material. You may not wield individual halves of the Myrnaxe.

**Sharrash:** Similar to a scythe, the Talenta Sharrash developed by the halflings of the Plains consists of a sicklelike blade at the end of a long pole.

**Tangat:** The Tangat, developed by the halflings of the Talenta Plains, features a curved blade (like a scimitar's) mounted on a short haft.

|
## Gear Descriptions
**Spellshard (Blank)** A spellcaster can mystically imprint spells into an Eberron dragonshard rather than physically writing them into a spellbook. A single spellshard is about the size of a human fist. The spellcaster can concentrate on the shard in order to bring any spell stored in it into focus; the spell appears as silvery writing within the swirling colours of the shard. Each Spellshard can hold up to 100 spells. The Price listed is for a blank Spellshard.

**Clothing, darkweave:** A character wearing darkweave gains a +1 item bonus on stealth checks made in shadowy illumination or dark conditions. Darkweave clothing costs 100 gp more than a normal outfit of the same sort, gains the same benefits (such as High Fashion Fine Clothing), and weighs the same.

**Clothing, glamerweave**: A character wearing glamerweave clothing gains a +1 item bonus on Diplomacy checks. Glamerweave clothing costs 100 gp more than a normal outfit of the same sort and gains the same benefits (such as High Fashion Fine Clothing).

**Arcane Signet Ring:** The dragonmarked houses of Khorvaire use these rings extensively for identification purposes.

**Signet Brooch** Other members of a dragonmarked house, whether actual scions or important hired help, wear signet brooches to identify their affiliation.

**Identification Papers:** These papers present a detailed physical description of a person (the wealthy sometimes commission small portraits of themselves), the person’s name and residence, and in some cases additional information about the person’s affiliations (particularly including any connection to a dragonmarked house, royalty, or a large institution).

**Letter of Credit:** A character who has funds on deposit in a Kundarak bank can request from the bank a letter of credit, which allows them to withdraw funds from a different bank branch. Letters of credit are always notarized with arcane marks (usually by gnomes from House Sivis), making them practically impossible to forge.

**Traveling Papers:** Anyone who travels across national borders is usually required to carry travelling papers identifying them, their residence, their destination, and their reason for travel.

Minor (unusual) | 2 gp | 4 gp | 10 gp
Moderate | 4 gp | 8 gp | 20 gp
Major | 6 gp | 12 gp | 30 pg

**Cosmetic Transmutation** With the widespread arcane magic that exists in Eberron, transmutation has become widespread for cosmetics. This can be anything from a minor natural change such as hair colour to a moderate change such as height or sex, to a major change such as a full physical impersonation of a specific individual.
See Exploring Eberron pg 28 for more information

**Courier service (House Orien)** The price varies based on the weight, and ease of access to the destination of the package. For an extra fee, Orien will use House Kundarak's services to apply a glyph of warding spell to the package.

**Mail service (House Orien)**  Sending mail is inexpensive, but is limited in size. If the security of the letter is important, Orien will use House Sivis' services to protect the messages - either by cryptography or secret page spell.

**Message Station (House Sivis)** For even faster communication, House Sivis' services are employed. On a per word basis, House Sivis broadcast stations can send messages across their network. These networks are built with Speaking Stones, which are detailed in the magic items section.

**Translation (House Sivis)** For a fee, House Sivis can translate any document, provided it is a Common or Uncommon language. Exotic languages might be translated by experts in House Sivis for an increased fee.
=
# Transportation ((+Transporation))
The following modes of transportation are available as services to the people of Eberron.
##### Table 7-6: Transportation 
Service | Price | Speed

Magebred coach (House Orien) | 5 cp per 5 miles | 5 mph
Teleportation circle (House Orien) | 250 gp | Instant

**Airship (House Lyrandar)** Airships primarily travel between major cities with docking towers, but not bound to terrain, these airships can provide transportation to any location.

**Elemental galleon (House Lyrandar)** Elemental galleons have an advantage over more mundane sea fairing vessels, as they are not subject to the will of the wind.

**Lightning Rail** A large elemental engine tows cars behind it on a rail system that can handle heavy weights over a long distance. The various classes of transportation provide different levels of standards of living for the time that passengers are on the rail network. First Class is in the realm of Fine living, Standard is Comfortable, and Steerage affords cheap-but a sustenance-level of travel.

**Magebred Coach** These coaches are much like a Carriage trip but are pulled by well trained and swift animals that provide an advantage over standard Carriages.

**Teleportation Circle** House Orien manages a network of teleportation circles between the major cities of Eberron. For a fee per person, House Orien allows transit between any of these points.

note(
Magic level listed is the suggested maximum that could be found, and may not be present or accessible to adventurers. Beyond 3rd level spells, 4th and 5th level capable casters are likely rare or unique NPCs who may be entirely unavailable, or unwilling, to meet adventurers. 6th and 7th level capable casters are considered a Unique rarity, and a GM should always consider how such a powerful NPC is present in the world. Higher-level items may be theorized about in the arcane centres of Khorvaire, and blueprints might be available, but the odds of finding items of 10th level or beyond available for retail is unlikely.

# Siberys powder
## Item 0+
-
; Uncommon, Alchemical, Consumable
**Ammunition** round

**Activate** :a: Interact
-
Siberys powder is a volatile and explosive alchemical substance commonly used in the production of wand munitions. Siberys powder becomes inert and useless when wet and must be kept in a sealed, water-tight container.
-
**Type** dose or round; **Level** 0; **Price** 1cp
The smallest unit of siberys powder that still has a simple use, a dose can be a simple package paper parcel around siberys powder or it can be packaged with a metal bullet or pellet to be used as ammunition. When ignited with an arcane spark or mundane fire, a dose of siberys powder explodes. This isn't powerful enough to deal damage but it makes a loud sound and could trigger further explosions. A fuse for a dose can be created with a few twists of paper and causes the dose to explode the round after it's lit.
-
**Type** horn; **Level** 2; **Price** 5 gp
A horn contains 500 doses worth of siberys powder. A horn can be detonated by leaving a small trail of siberys powder and then lighting it. Each 5-foot square requires one dose of siberys powder to create a trail through. As long as the horn is

mostly full (at least 400 doses remaining) it can be detonated to deal 1d6 fire damage in a 5-foot burst (DC 16 basic Reflex save). It takes 1 round per 15 feet of powder trail laid down for a horn to detonate after the trail is lit. If multiple horns detonate simultaneously, it can increase the area of the explosion, but the damage in overlapping areas doesn't increase.
-
**Type** keg; **Level** 6; **Price** 50 gp
A keg contains 5,000 doses of siberys powder and can be detonated in the same way as a horn. As long as the keg is mostly full (at least 4,000 doses remaining) this deals 3d6 fire damage in a 20-foot burst (DC 20 basic Reflex save). Detonating multiple kegs can increase the area, but not the damage, of this effect; detonating a keg and any horns at the same time in an overlapping area also doesn't increase the damage.

# Dragonmark Focus Items ((Dragonmark Focus Items))
Much of the influence of the dragonmarked houses is based on a simple principle: it’s easier to amplify an existing magical effect, such as that of a dragonmark, than to create the same effect from nothing. Over the course of centuries, House Cannith and the Twelve have developed items that focus and enhance the powers of the mark to produce powerful, reliable effects.

# Final Messenger
## Item 1
-
; Invested, Magical, Warforged
**Usage** worn; **Bulk** L

**Price** 5 gp
-
A final messenger is a tiny homunculus-a delicate winged creature designed to facilitate communication between warforged soldiers during the Last War. If you are a warforged, you can invest in the Final Messenger item to hold a final messenger and integrate it into your body. While it is part of your body, the messenger cannot be targeted by any attack. You can only have one messenger attached to your body at a time.

A final messenger holds four pieces of data, accessible only to the warforged it is attached to:
- A destination for the messenger. This can be very specific (a particular apartment in Sharn) or more general (an open marketplace).
- A target individual. This could be a specific person or a category (“Any Karrnathi warforged”).
- A single image recorded through the eyes of a warforged attached to the messenger.
- A message of up to 25 words. 
  

A final messenger uses the Homunculus stat block but loses the Master Link, and all attacks. It gains the Mindless trait adjusting to Int -5, Wis 0, and Cha -5. A messenger can only remain active for 8 hours after it detaches from a warforged body, after which time its energy dissipates and it falls unconscious. An unconscious messenger must complete 8 hours attached to a warforged, after which it regains its energy, as well as regaining all lost hit points.


**Activate** 1 minute Interact; **Effect** While the messenger is attached to you, you can spend 1 minute reviewing the data currently stored within the final messenger, and if you choose, change any or all of these data points.

**Activate** :a: Interact; **Effect** You release the final messenger, at which point it flies to its destination by the most direct route possible. Once it reaches the destination it seeks the target individual; if no target has been set, it approaches the nearest warforged.
