# Weapons, Armour, and Adventuring Gear ((Weapons, Armour, and Adventuring Gear))
The world of Eberron is built on both arcane and mundane innovation, much of it powered by House Cannith. The following equipment has been developed in Eberron, whether by a specific culture, ancient civilization, or by the research funds of a nation's war machine.

## Armour Traits
**Primal:** This armour is created entirely out of primal components, and can be considered wooden armour for druid and other anathemas.
## Armour Descriptions
**Darkleaf:** Similar to leafweave armour, darkleaf armour is made of carefully cured and beautifully carved pieces of wood, supplemented by treated
|
leaves. This special process enables the many primal practitioners of the world a sturdy, yet entirely natural armour.

**Leafweave:** The artisans of Aerenal weave suits of armour from leaves and wood, which are then treated by a special process that makes them as tough and flexible as leather. This special process enables the many primal practitioners of the world a sturdy, yet entirely natural armour.
=  
## Weapon Traits
**Dual:** A single dual weapon is balanced such that their flurry of blows land with the speed of two weapons. Dual weapons satisfy requirements of dual-wielding melee weapons, such as for the Ranger Twin Takedown feat.

**Drow:** Drow craft and use these weapons.

**Gnoll:** The Znir consider these weapons to be a signature weapon of their pact and don’t sell them to outsiders. The only way to acquire a gnoll weapon is to be given one or to take it from a fallen foe.

**Returning:** When you make a thrown attack with this weapon and roll a failure, the weapon returns to you if you have a free hand.
  
## Critical Specialization Effects
**Boomerang:** Choose one creature other than the initial target within the first range increment of you. If its AC is lower than your attack roll result for the critical hit, you deal damage to that creature equal to the result of the weapon damage die you rolled (including extra dice for its potency rune, if any). This amount isn't doubled, and no bonuses or other additional dice apply to this damage.
    
## Weapon Descriptions
**Boomerang, Talenta:** The halflings of the Talenta Plains use traditional boomerangs - simple curved, polished sticks designed to return to the thrower.

**Boomerang, Xen'drik:** The drow of Xen'drik use three-pronged bladed boomerangs to hunt prey. Some adventurers and explorers learn to use the weapon while operating in the Xen'drik jungles, but few outside the drow communities ever master the intricacies of the Xen'drik boomerang.

**Double-Bladed Scimitar:** The Double-Bladed Scimitar is the signature weapon of Valenar elves. A haft of fine wood supports a long, curving blade on either end. Forged with techniques honed over centuries, these blades are strong, sharp, and remarkably light. Each scimitar is a masterpiece, and as a result, the double-bladed scimitar is an expensive weapon - few though ever have the opportunity to purchase one. A Valenar blade in the hands of a non-elf is generally assumed to have been stolen or looted from a fallen foe, and a Valenar elf might
|
feel entitled to demand its return or challenge the bearer to prove they’re worthy to wield it.

**Gnollbow:** Though the gnollbow is not significantly larger than a normal longbow, the draw of the weapon is deceptively heavy. Gnollbows are made from horn, a darkwood core, and sinew laminated together to increase the power of its pull and the force of its projectile. This allows the bow to fire larger projectiles at much higher velocity, resulting in greater penetrating power. You must use two hands to fire it, and it cannot be used while mounted. Any time an ability is specifically restricted to a longbow, such as Erastil’s favoured weapon, it also applies to gnollbows unless otherwise stated. To craft a gnollbow, you must have at least 5sp worth of darkwood to form the core of the weapon. 

**Myrnaxe** As mercenaries in a land of monsters, the Znir gnolls prepare to face a wide range of exotic opponents. With this in mind, the Eyre clan produces a weapon they call the myrnaxe, named for the smith who created it. A myrnaxe has a sturdy wooden haft with a curved axe blade on one end and a long spearhead on the other. Depending on the wielder's stance, the myrnaxe is either functionally a battleaxe or a spear. A user may switch between the sides of the myrnaxe with an interact action. The myrnaxe has the damage, hands, group, and weapon traits of the side in user.  Myrnaxes are composed of two attached items: the Myrnaxe - Axe, and the Myrnaxe - Spearhead. It’s common for each head to be made of a different metal, so the spearhead might be silver while the axe blade is made of byeshk-thus maximizing its versatility against multiple foes. When crafting a myrnaxe, both sides are manufactured at the same time, using their respective crafting costs for material, and forming a completed Myrnaxe when finished. Each side of the weapon gains the effect of its respective precious material. You may not wield individual halves of the Myrnaxe.

**Sharrash:** Similar to a scythe, the Talenta Sharrash developed by the halflings of the Plains consists of a sicklelike blade at the end of a long pole.

**Tangat:** The Tangat, developed by the halflings of the Talenta Plains, features a curved blade (like a scimitar's) mounted on a short haft.

## Gear Descriptions
**Spellshard (Blank)** A spellcaster can mystically imprint spells into an Eberron dragonshard rather than physically writing them into a spellbook. A single spellshard is about the size of a human fist. The spellcaster can concentrate on the shard in order to bring any spell stored in it into focus; the spell appears as silvery writing within the swirling colours of the shard. Each Spellshard can hold up to 100 spells. The Price listed is for a blank Spellshard.

**Clothing, darkweave:** Darkweave fabric has strands of shadow interwoven with black threads to produce a coarse but beautiful cloth. A character wearing darkweave gains a +1 item bonus on stealth checks made in shadowy illumination or dark conditions. Darkweave clothing costs 100 gp more than a normal outfit of the same sort, gains the same benefits (such as High Fashion Fine Clothing), and weighs the same.

**Clothing, glamerweave**: Glamerweave is a fine, light fabric that has delicate illusions woven into its threads. The colour of glamerweave seems to shift subtly and is hard to describe, but this property makes for a striking and strangely beautiful appearance. A character wearing glamerweave clothing gains a +1 item bonus on Diplomacy checks. Glamerweave clothing costs 100 gp more than a normal outfit of the same sort and gains the same benefits (such as High Fashion Fine Clothing).

**Arcane Signet Ring:** The dragonmarked houses of Khorvaire use these rings extensively for identification purposes. They resemble ordinary signet rings but are set with gemstones like more decorative rings. Inside a large central gemstone, an intricate runic pattern, which is an arcane mark,
|
becomes visible when worn by the person for whom it was constructed. It is extremely unusual for anyone who does not have the Favored in House feat to carry an arcane signet ring.

**Signet Brooch** Other members of a dragonmarked house, whether actual scions or important hired help, wear signet brooches to identify their affiliation. These items don’t contain an arcane mark like the Arcane Signet Ring but are well made from expensive materials.

**Identification Papers:** Most people of the middle and upper classes, at least in the most civilized areas of Khorvaire (Aundair, Breland, Karrnath, Thrane, Zilargo, and the Mror Holds) carry identification papers with them at all times. Issued by national governments and notarized by House Sivis, these papers present a detailed physical description of a person (the wealthy sometimes commission small portraits of themselves), the person’s name and residence, and in some cases additional information about the person’s affiliations (particularly including any connection to a dragonmarked house, royalty, or a large institution).

**Letter of Credit:** House Kundarak, the house that carries the Mark of Warding, operates banks throughout central Khorvaire. A character who has funds on deposit in a Kundarak bank can request from the bank a letter of credit, which allows them to withdraw funds from a different bank branch. For many characters, this system is a convenient alternative to carrying wealth around in the form of precious gems, jewellery, or coins. Letters of credit are always notarized with arcane marks (usually by gnomes from House Sivis), making them practically impossible to forge. House Kundarak does not charge a fee for issuing letters of credit.
=
**Traveling Papers:** Anyone who travels across national borders is usually required to carry travelling papers identifying them, their residence, their destination, and their reason for travel. Travelling papers consist of a parchment sheet with the appropriate information and an arcane mark, carried in a leather folder. House Sivis, House Orien, House Deneith, and House Lyrandar all offer travelling papers that are recognized throughout central Khorvaire.

##### Table 6-5-3: Cosmetic Transmutation Services ((++Cosmetic Services))
Service | Price (1 Week) | Price (1 Month) | Permanent
--- | :--- | :--- | :---
Minor (natural) | 1gp | 2 gp | 5 gp
Minor (unusual) | 2 gp | 4 gp | 10 gp
Moderate | 4 gp | 8 gp | 20 gp
Major | 6 gp | 12 gp | 30 pg
/

**Cosmetic Transmutation** With the widespread arcane magic that exists in Eberron, transmutation has become widespread for cosmetics. This can be anything from a minor natural change such as hair colour to a moderate change such as height or sex, to a major change such as a full physical impersonation of a specific individual. Note that identity theft is a crime under the Code of Galifar. See Exploring Eberron pg 28 for more information

**Courier service (House Orien)** The Courier service of house Orien carries messages and packages across Khorvaire. Packages and messages send by courier are more secure, but more expensive. The price varies based on the weight, and ease of access to the destination of the package. For an extra fee, Orien will use House Kundarak's services to apply a glyph of warding spell to the package.
|
**Mail service (House Orien)** The mail service of house Orien is the method by which most common folk of Eberron can communicate. Sending mail is expensive, but is limited in size. If the security of the letter is important, Orien will use House Sivis' services to protect the messages - either by cryptography or secret page spell.

**Magewrights** Magewrights are the backbone of Eberron's arcane industry. While they fill the role of a standard crafter - such as an Arcane Locksmith, Blacksmith, Healer, Potter, Tailor - they weave cantrips and magic into their work. See the Magewright entry for sample stat blocks.

**Message Station (House Sivis)** For even faster communication, House Sivis' services are employed. On a per word basis, House Sivis broadcast stations can send messages across their network. These networks are built with Speaking Stones, which are detailed in the magic items section.
=
**Translation (House Sivis)** For a fee, House Sivis can translate any document, provided it is a Common or Uncommon language. Exotic languages might be translated by experts in House Sivis for an increased fee. While House Sivis can attempt to break or Decipher Writing, this is not a service that is accessible to the public. If you have the Favoured in House feat, House Sivis may be willing to attempt this.
|
**Spellcasting** Houses can provide a casting of a spell from their Dragonmarked Spell List (detailed in each Dragonmarked Heritage). These spells are done at the cost of the Core Rulebook Table 6-15 plus any associated costs.

**Hirelings** Hirelings from the houses are either unmarked members (magewrights cost and stat block) or Least Dragonmarked members. See the Dragonmarked NPC entries for examples.
/
  
# Transportation ((+Transporation))
The following modes of transportation are available as services to the people of Eberron.
##### Table 6-6: Transportation 
Service | Price | Speed
--- | :--- | :---
Airship (House Lyrandar) | 5 sp per 5 miles | 20 mph
Elemental galleon (House Lyrandar) | 25 cp per 5 miles | 10 mph
Lightning rail, first-class (House Orien) | 2 sp, 5 cp per 5 miles | 30 mph
Lightning rail, standard (House Orien) | 1 sp per 5 miles | 30 mph
Lightning rail, steerage (House Orien) | 1 cp per 5 miles | 30 mph
Magebred coach (House Orien) | 15 cp per 5 miles | 5 mph
Teleportation circle (House Orien) | 250 gp | Instant
/
**Airship (House Lyrandar)** These elemental flying vessels are a new invention in the world of Eberron. Airships primarily travel between major cities with docking towers, but not bound to terrain, these airships can provide transportation to any location.

**Elemental galleon (House Lyrandar)** Elemental galleons have an advantage over more mundane sea fairing vessels, as they are not subject to the will of the wind. Elemental Galleons are uncommon, and regular vessels still see use through Eberron despite their advantages.

**Lightning Rail** Orien's lightning rail network was developed with the assistance of the united kingdom of Galifar. A large elemental engine tows cars behind it on a rail system that can handle heavy weights over a long distance. The various classes of transportation provide different levels of standards of living for the time that passengers are on the rail network. First Class is in the realm of Fine living, Standard is Comfortable, and Steerage affords cheap-but a sustenance-level of travel.

**Magebred Coach** One of the more refined methods of land travel, these coaches are much like a Carriage trip but are pulled by well trained and swift animals that provide an advantage over standard Carriages.
|
**Teleportation Circle** House Orien manages a network of teleportation circles between the major cities of Eberron. For a fee per person, House Orien allows transit between any of these points.

# Animals
##### Table 6-7: Animals ((+Animals))
Animal | Rental Price (per day) | Purchase Price
--- | :--- | :---
Carver | 1 gp per day | 32 gp (level 2)

     Magebred Warhorse | 1 gp per day | 60 gp (level 3)
     Magebred Pack Animal | 4 cp per day | 4 gp
     Magebred Riding Pony | 16 cp per day | 14 gp
     Magebred Warpony | 16 sp per day  | 48 gp (level 2)
Valenar Riding Horse | 3 sp per day | 20 gp* (level 3)
Valenar Guard Dog | 3 cp per day | 1 gp* (level 3)
. * Valenar elves do not sell their animals. However on the rare occasions when a Valenar animal chooses an adventurer of a different ancestry as a companion, it is universally accepted.
/
**Carver:** A close relative of the clawfoot, a carver is a predatory dinosaur, about the size of a heavy horse, native to the Talenta Plains. Known in some worlds as the deinonychus, it is listed in the monsters section of this guide.

**Clawfoot:** A human-sized predator of the Talenta Plains, this dinosaur is the halfling equivalent of a warhorse. Well trained and loyal, a clawfoot often continues fighting even after its rider’s death. It is listed in the monsters section of this guide.

**Fastieth:** A fast-running, plant-eating dinosaur, the fastieth is the halfling equivalent of a pony or riding a horse on the Talenta Plains. It is listed in the monsters section of this guide.

**Magebred Animal:** An animal magically bred by House Vadalis might have any of a number of useful qualities and is easier to train than a mundane animal. Magebred animals and the template are provided in the monsters section of this guide.

**Valenar Animals:** Valenar animals are awakened to advanced intelligence and power by the touch of an ancestral spirit. Traditionally, Valenar animals choose Valenar elves as companions, reflecting a bond between the ancestors of elf and animal. To be chosen by a Valenar animal is a great honour, and any such elf is treated with respect and reverence. Still, on the rare occasions when a Valenar animal chooses an adventurer of a different ancestry as a companion, it is universally accepted. Valenar animals are provided in the monsters section of this guide.

# Magic Gear ((+Magic Gear))
Eberron is a world built on a widespread arcane industry. As a result, low-level magic items and spells are relatively easily accessible. The following magical items may be of use to adventurers, but are not necessarily the only ones that exist. There are also a number of more "mundane" magical items that aid common folk with their day to day tasks. Brooms that sweep with the snap of your fingers, Everbright lanterns that glow without fuel, or more. The following items, though magical, should not be considered typical magical items as rewards. These items should be relatively (except in the case of uncommon) easily available in most places.

Town Size | Magic Level | Item Level
--- | :---
Thorp | Cantrips | 1st level
Hamlet | 1st level | 2nd level
Village | 2nd level | 3rd level
Small Town | 3rd level | 5th level
Large Town | 3rd level | 7th level
Small City | 4th level | 9th level
Large City | 4th level | 11th level
Metropolis | 5th level | 13th level 

note(
Magic level listed is the suggested maximum that could be found, and may not be present or accessible to adventurers. Beyond 3rd level spells, 4th and 5th level capable casters are likely rare or unique NPCs who may be entirely unavailable, or unwilling, to meet adventurers. 6th and 7th level capable casters are considered a Unique rarity, and a GM should always consider how such a powerful NPC is present in the world. Higher-level items may be theorized about in the arcane centres of Khorvaire, and blueprints might be available, but the odds of finding items of 10th level or beyond available for retail is unlikely.

)
=
note(
It is important to qualify that while Cannith engineers are working on solving the overcharging problem, there are no solutions yet. In the event a charge of the Breath of Siberys is applied to a magic item with charges remaining, the item is subject to overcharging. The next time that a charge is expended from the item, roll a DC 10 flat check. On a success, the item is broken. On a failure, the item is destroyed.

# Dragonmark Focus Items ((Dragonmark Focus Items))
Much of the influence of the dragonmarked houses is based on a simple principle: it’s easier to amplify an existing magical effect, such as that of a dragonmark, than to create the same effect from nothing. Over the course of centuries, House Cannith and the Twelve have developed items that focus and enhance the powers of the mark to produce powerful, reliable effects.
-
)
Dragonmark focus items are rarely sold in stores. They can only be created using proprietary tools, and are produced exclusively by House Cannith and the Twelve for use by trusted agents of the dragonmarked houses. So while many Medani inquisitives wear Medi spectacles, they acquired them through service to the house, not by purchasing them with gold. While a dragonmark focus item usually has the same general appearance as the item whose effects it duplicates, it bears the image of the required mark somewhere on the item and often carries the sigil of the associated house. Siberys dragonshards are a vital component of focus items, most including a shard in some form. [54]

The following items are Dragonmark focus items. They function identically to the duplicated item, however, their level is reduced by 1. The price, but no other statistics are similarly reduced to the new level. All these items gain the Invested, and Dragonmark trait. You may only invest in the item if you have the requisite dragonmark.

While they are almost trivially simple to produce, these charms are critically important to the warding services of House Kundarak. When a character uses the Mark of Warding to cast alarm, arcane lock, glyph of warding, or any other warding spell which selects targets and ignores the caster, they can invest ownership of the spell into a keycharm. Whoever holds the charm is considered to be the caster of the spell for purposes of bypassing its effects (or receiving the mental alert from an alarm).
    The charm has no inherent powers, and if the spell it is linked to expires, it is considered to be a mundane 
object-although a dragonmarked character could link it to a new warding spell.

Tied to the Mark of Passage, this object acts as a magical beacon to Orien heirs slipping through the Astral Plane. An astral beacon is an 8-inch sphere formed from silver and crystal, with the dragonshard at the core; it is often encased in lead or embedded in the floor of a chamber to prevent enemies from stealing or smashing the sphere.
    A character with the Mark of Passage using any feature with the teleportation trait may double the range of the teleportation effect as long as the destination point is within 10 feet of an astral beacon. In addition, for the purposes of teleport, selecting a location within 10 feet of an astral beacon is always accurate within 20 feet no matter the distance travelled.
    In addition, when used in a Teleportation Circle ritual, if an Astral Beacon is at the target destination and the ritual is a success, the ritual is a critical success instead. Any caster performing the Teleportation circle ritual with an Astral Beacon can use their Mark of Passage spell modifier instead of their normal check, each caster that does so gains a +1 status bonus to their check for each dragonmark focus point they choose to spend on the ritual.

Byeshk is a rare and heavy metal of lustrous purple, mined from the Byeshk and Graywall Mountains along Droaam’s borders. It can also be found in the Ironlands, a Khyberian demiplane that’s been delved into by the Ghaash’kala and Kech Sharaat. Aberrations tied to the daelkyr-including dolgaunts, dolgrims, and mind flayers-are susceptible to weapons made of byeshk alloys, making the metal highly valued to the Dhakaani, Gatekeepers druids, and others that fight aberrations. Dhakaani weapons forged during the Xoriat Incursion were often forged from byeshk. Byeshk is difficult to work into armour, and it offers no significant advantage over iron armour.

# Bronzewood

This exceptionally hard wood, native to Aerenal, is useful in the manufacture of armour and weapons. Unlike most woods, bronzewood can be used instead of metal to fashion heavy armour and weapons - it is somewhat shapeable during manufacturing, and it keeps a sharp edge.

Eberron dragonshards also called bloodstones, are found encased in geode like stone shells-egg-shaped rocks perhaps a foot across. These stone shells usually lie just below the surface of the ground, covered by 2 to 10 feet of dirt and sediment, but always above the bedrock layer. Since Eberron dragonshards are not found buried within rock, most shard fields are in lowlands, as opposed to mountains or rocky barrens.

-
; Precious
While Siberys shards are the rarest variety of dragonshard, Khyber shards are the most hazardous to obtain. Despite the hazards, Khyber shards fuel so much of Khorvaire’s industry that it's worth the risk for the payout. Khyber shards are found in everything from lightning rails to airships to elemental forges which increase the output of many of Khorvaire’s smiths and craftsmen. Khyber shards are found only in the depths of Khyber, growing in clusters on cavern walls and floors near pools of magma. The dragonshards reflect the orange-red glow of the molten rock, and the silhouette of a swirling dragonmark is barely visible within the smoky crystal.

Siberys shards fall from the Ring of Siberys, and as a result, are usually found in Xen’drik and other equatorial regions. Their crystalline depths contain pulsating golden veins. The rarest of the dragonshard varieties, Siberys shards are also sometimes called sunstones or starmotes, and their connection to the dragonmarked houses means that they are often simply called dragonshards with no qualification. Dragonshards are rarely found large enough to be crafted into items of any significant size.

## Item 4
-
; Consumable, Magical, Snare, Trap
**Price** 15 gp

**Usage** held in 1 hand, see details; **Bulk** 1
-
A blast disk holds destructive arcane power. A typical blast disk is about nine inches in diameter and one inch thick, made from layers of different metal; dragonshards are embedded in the surface of the disk and arcane symbols are engraved on its surface.

**Trigger** After activating the item, the condition you select becomes the trigger of the item. You can also choose to ignore the trigger and immediately activate the payload.
**Time** When the disk is activated, the user can set a time delay of up to 10 minutes before it releases its effect.
**Proximity** 30 seconds after the disk is activated, it can trigger when someone comes within a certain distance of the disk or when someone first makes contact with the disk, then breaks that contact.
**Impact** The activated disk can be set to detonate on impact, then used by throwing or dropping it.  
  

**Payload** When the blast disk is triggered, it produces one of the following magical effects, chosen when it was manufactured:
**Explosive** The creates an explosion in a 20-foot burst centred on the disk. Each creature in the area must make a DC 18 basic reflex save, dealing 6d6 fire damage. Explosive blast disk damage ignores up to 10 hardness of objects and structures. Unattended objects and structures automatically critically fail the reflex save.
**Spell** While crafting this item, if a Spell of a lower level than the item is cast into it, you may instead store the effects of the spell in the disk. The stored spell must take 3 actions or fewer to cast, have a hostile effect, and target one creature or have an area. 
)
|
item(
Once a spell is stored in the disk, the disk gains all the traits of that spell. If the stored spell targets one or more creatures, it targets the creature that set off the glyph. If it has an area, that area is centred on the creature that set off the glyph. The disk counts as a magical trap, using your spell DC for both the Perception check to notice it and the Thievery check to disable it; both checks require the creature attempting them to be trained to succeed.

These infamous +2 greater striking daggers, prized by assassins, have a Khyber dragonshard embedded into the pommel that channels the souls of victims but doesn’t itself trap them. There’s much debate over the actual fate of the souls of those slain by a Keeper’s Fang. The common myth says that the souls of victims are trapped in the Lair of the Keeper, and heroes can seek to reclaim a soul from the Sovereign of Death and Decay. Another myth maintains that these weapons channel souls to the overlord Katashka, and that one must deal with the Lords of Dust to restore a victim. Most Keeper’s Fangs were created by the Shaarat’khesh assassins of the Empire of Dhakaan.

# Final Messenger

; Invested, Magical, Warforged
**Usage** worn; **Bulk** L

**Price** 5 gp
-
A final messenger is a tiny homunculus-a delicate winged creature designed to facilitate communication between warforged soldiers during the Last War. If you are a warforged, you can invest in the Final Messenger item to hold a final messenger and integrate it into your body. While it is part of your body, the messenger cannot be targeted by any attack. You can only have one messenger attached to your body at a time.

A final messenger holds four pieces of data, accessible only to the warforged it is attached to:
- A destination for the messenger. This can be very specific (a particular apartment in Sharn) or more general (an open marketplace).
- A target individual. This could be a specific person or a category (“Any Karrnathi warforged”).
- A single image recorded through the eyes of a warforged attached to the messenger.
- A message of up to 25 words. 
  

A final messenger uses the Homunculus stat block but loses the Master Link, and all attacks. It gains the Mindless trait adjusting to Int -5, Wis 0, and Cha -5. A messenger can only remain active for 8 hours after it detaches from a warforged body, after which time its energy dissipates and it falls unconscious. An unconscious messenger must complete 8 hours attached to a warforged, after which it regains its energy, as well as regaining all lost hit points.


**Activate** 1 minute Interact; **Effect** While the messenger is attached to you, you can spend 1 minute reviewing the data currently stored within the final messenger, and if you choose, change any or all of these data points.

When you sleep with an uul’kur on your person, you remain fully lucid when you dream, and when you wake, you clearly remember everything that transpired. If you understand the workings of the uul’kur, you can use 11 minutes to bind it to your dreams until dawn the next day.

This small carved stone is typically bound to a leather strap worn around the wrist or neck. Designed by the Dhakaani duur’kala, the vola’khesh facilitates communication between elite units. They are created in linked sets; up to ten stones can be bound together, and once established, this link cannot be changed. At present, the vola’khesh are only used by the Kech Dhakaan and are unknown to the people of the Five Nations. 
If the enchantments were replicated, these tools could be put into use by spies and law enforcement agencies of the Five Nations.

**Crafting Requirements** Any vola'khesh which you are linking to the newly crafted stone must be present for the full duration of the crafting.
