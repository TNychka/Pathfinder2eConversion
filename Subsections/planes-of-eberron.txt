# The Planes of Eberron ((+Planes of Eberron))
Eberron is a world alone in its planar cosmology, unattached to the rest of the multiverse. Eberron sits at the centre of thirteen outer planes, all of which influence the material plane differently. Each plane is a piece that composes the world of Eberron, though some connections are more noticeable than others.
-
)

The thirteen planes of Eberron are complex and exist as the total embodiment of a concept in all its forms. The planes interact with Eberron and manifest their concepts and effects on the material plane. This can come in the form of being coterminous or remote - in which the planes effect becomes more or less dramatic across the world, or in the form of Manifest Zones which directly affect a small region of the world.

info(
For more information on the planes of Eberron, see **Exploring Eberron** Chapter 5.
)
/
## Planar Effects
Planar Effects detail the major mechanical changes that a creature from a different plane might experience while visiting the plane. Though there are numerous other minor effects that you can add to your planes. While the planar effects may wax or wane depending on your location in the plane, they are typically always present no matter where you are in the plane.

## Manifest Zones
Manifest zones typically have one or two planar traits or some minor other effects detailed in the manifest zone section. However, some manifest zones can have none or even all of the effects depending on the zone's strength.

## Coterminous and Remote
The planes of Eberron seem to follow cycles of Coterminous phases and Remote phases. Typically, when coterminous, manifest zones associated with the plane are stronger, but when remote, manifest zones associated with the plane become weaker or can even temporarily disappear altogether.

# Daanvi: The Perfect Order ((++Daanvi))
## Plane
-
; LN, Flowing, Immeasurable
**Moon** Nymm, the Crown

**Moon and Portal Colour** Yellow-gold

**Native Inhabitants** Modrons, Inevitables, Angels, Devils

# &nbsp;
## Planar Effects
-
**Plane of Truth.** A creature under these effects can't speak any deliberate and intentional lies and takes a –4 status penalty to Deception checks.

**Impeded Illusion.** When a creature casts an illusion spell that has a duration of 1 minute or longer, the duration is halved.

**The Eyes of the Law.** When a creature casts a divination spell, its range is doubled; if that spell has a duration of at least 1 minute but less than 24 hours, the duration is also doubled.

**No Chance.** The first time in a combat round (always, in exploration mode) that a creature makes an attack roll, skill check, or saving throw (other than a recovery check), treat the roll as a 10. Neither Fortune nor Misfortune traits can be used while under this planar effect.

**Flowing Time.** For every 10 minutes that pass in Daanvi, only 1 minute passes in the Material Plane.

# &nbsp;
## Manifest Zone
-
Manifest zones of Daanvi are uncommon, but those that do manifest typically present one of the plane's properties. Inside the manifest zone, things are unnaturally orderly.

# &nbsp;
## Coterminous and Remote
-
Daanvi has coterminous and remote periods, but unlike those of other planes, these periods have no obvious effects.

# &nbsp;
## Planar Effects
-
**Extremely Morphic.** The environment of Dal Quor can shift at any moment. These changes are generally drawn from the mind of the current dreamer, but the thoughts of adventurers might impact another creature’s dream that they’re currently experiencing.

**Extended Illusion.** When a creature casts an illusion spell, its range is doubled; if that spell has a duration of at least 1 minute but less than 24 hours, the duration is also doubled.

**Flowing Time.** For every 10 minutes that pass in Dal Quor, only 1 minute passes on the Material Plane.

# Dolurrh: The Realm of The Dead ((++Dolurrh))

**Native Inhabitants** The Quick, the Dead, the Lingering
# &nbsp;
## Planar Effects
-
**Eternal Ennui.** When a creature enters Dolurrh, its doomed condition immediately increases to a minimum of 1. While in Dolurrh, your doomed condition cannot be removed or reduced by rest or by any other means - though it can be suppressed. After leaving Dolurrh, the doomed condition fades as normal. Creatures native to Dolurrh are immune to this property’s effects.

**Impeded Magic.** To use the Cast a Spell activity for a 1st level or higher spell, a creature must succeed on a flat check of DC 5 + spell level. On a failed check, the action fails and its spell slot is not expended, but the actions are still consumed.

**Inevitable Entrapment.** Every 24 hours a living creature spends in Dolurrh, it must make a DC 20 Will saving throw. On a failed save, it increases its doomed condition by 1. For every saving throw made, the DC increases by 1. Creatures native to Dolurrh are immune to this property’s effects.

**Timeless.** Time passes at the same rate as on the material plane and is consistent across its layers. Creatures can benefit from resting, suffer damage, and die. However, a creature on Dolurrh doesn’t age and doesn’t need to eat, sleep, or drink.

# &nbsp;
## Manifest Zone
-
It is uncommon for a Dolurrh manifest zone to have any of the plane's properties. When a zone manifests an effect, it is typically one of the following

**Path of the Dead** Dolurrh manifest zones can act as a gateway into Dolurrh. Sometimes this may require a ritual or sacrifice to activate, or other times it may simply depend on the alignment of the Aryth or Dolurrh being conterminous.

**The way is shut.** When resurrection magic is used in a Dolurrh manifest zone with this effect, it can backfire dangerously
|
Effect | When Dolurrh is coterminous | When Dolurrh is remote
--- | --- | ---
1d4 status penalty to the primary check of a resurrection ritual | yes | yes
The resurrection ritual is always a critical failure | no | yes
The resurrection is a success, but a creature of Dolurrh also returns with the intended target | yes | no
If the resurrection is a critical success, it is reduced to success instead | yes | yes
The level of success of the resurrection is always one step lower | no | yes

**They will answer.** When resurrection magic is used in a Dolurrh manifest zone with this effect, it can be a boon to bringing the soul back

Effect | When Dolurrh is Coterminous | When Dolurrh is Remote
--- | --- | ---
1d4 status bonus to the primary check of a resurrection ritual | yes | yes
The resurrection ritual is always a critical success | yes | no
If the resurrection is a critical failure, it is only a failure instead | yes | yes
The level of success of the resurrection is always one step higher | yes | no
The material cost of resurrection is halved | yes | yes

**Speaker for the Dead** In these Manifest Zones, anyone can cast the spell Talking Corpse with a casting time of one hour as long as they have a personal connection to the deceased whose corpse they are questioning.

# &nbsp;
## Coterminous and Remote
-
When Dolurrh is coterminous, ghosts and spirits of Dolurrh are significantly more common - especially near Dolurrh's manifest zones. 

While Dolurrh is remote, resurrection magic outside of Dolurrh's manifest zones always fails. The soul cannot return from Dolurrh, and the only way to raise the dead is by travelling to Dolurrh itself to retrieve the soul.

# &nbsp;
## Planar Effects
-
**Burning Bright.** When you make a recovery check and you are still dying after applying its effects, make another recovery check.

**Deadly Heat.** All regions of Fernia are subject to temperatures of extreme heat (Core Rulebook page 517), though many regions reach temperatures of incredible heat. All creatures increase their resistance to cold damage by 5.

**Empowered Fire.** Fire spells are enhanced, while cold and water spells are impeded (Gamemastery Guide page 136). When you Cast a Spell with the fire trait, that spell is automatically heightened 1 level, up to a level equal to the highest spell level you can cast.

**Fire Energy Ley Line.** Fernia is attuned to fire energy, and by tapping into this source you can enhance fire spells using that energy’s power. The strength of this power varies throughout Fernia. (Secrets of Magic pg 214)

**Fires of Industry.** When making a crafting check involving the use of fire (such as cooking or smithing), you gain a +2 item bonus to your check.

**Standard Time.** Time passes at the same pace as on the Material Plane and is consistent across its layers.

# &nbsp;
## Manifest Zones
-
A Fernia manifest zone typically manifests one or two of the planar effects. In addition, it may have the following additional properties.

**Continual Flame** Motes of continual flame are spontaneously generated in this region, typically attached to some vegetation or minerals from the area. These flames persist even if they are removed from the region.

**Geothermal** The area is dotted with pools of molten earth and fissures of scalding water, from which mephits and elementals emerge with regularity.

# &nbsp;
## Coterminous and Remote
-
When Fernia is coterminous, temperatures across Eberron rise sharply. Regions that are already hot can become dangerously hot - and can begin to manifest the Fernia Planar traits even if unassociated with a Manifest Zone.

While Fernia is remote, intense heat loses some of its edge. Regions of high temperature become one stage lower than normal. In addition, creatures increase their resistance to fire damage by 5.

# &nbsp;
## Planar Effects
-
**Positive Power.** Positive spells are enhanced, while negative spells are impeded (Gamemastery Guide page 136). When you Cast a Spell with the positive trait, that spell is automatically heightened 1 level, up to a level equal to the highest spell level you can cast.

**Negative Void.** To Cast a Spell that deals negative damage, a creature must succeed on a flat check with a DC equal to 5 + the level of the spell. On a failed check, the spell is not cast and its spell slot is not expended, but the actions are lost.

**Pure Light.** There is no darkness in Irian. Any spell, effect, or other situation that would usually create darkness instead only reduces the lighting to dim light.

**Life Triumphant.** When making a medicine check, you gain a +2 item bonus to your check, and any creature which rests doubles their number of restored hit points. In addition, all non-undead creatures gain a +2 status bonus to saves against fear, poison, and disease effects. In addition, on initiative count 20 a creature with at least 1 hit point regains 1 hit point, and a creature with the dying condition loses the dying condition and becomes stable.

**Undead Bane.** Creatures with the undead trait are sickened 2, they may not reduce this sickened value until they escape the effects of Irian. This does not affect undead creatures that are sustained by Irian, such as the deathless elves of Aerenal.

**Positive Energy Ley Line.** Irian is attuned to positive energy, and by tapping into this source you can enhance positive spells using that energy’s power. The strength of this power varies throughout Irian. (Secrets of Magic pg 214)

**Standard Time.** Time passes at the same pace as on the Material Plane and is consistent across its layers.
|
# &nbsp;
## Manifest Zones
-
An Irian manifest zone typically manifests one or two of the planar effects, though only rarely does it extend the full effects of Life Triumphant. In addition, it may have the following additional properties.

**Restorative Springs** The waters of a spring hold curative powers - removing disease, healing wounds, even restoring lost senses.

**Positive Crystals** Clusters of radiant crystals sprout from the earth. These crystals typically emanate the Positive Power planar effect, and some particularly potent crystals even replicate the Positive trait of the plane.

In addition to the above uncommon effects, all Irian manifest zones always have the following effects

**Positive Influence** Plants and animals thrive in these zones, and people are less likely to dwell on negative emotions and find it easier to embrace hope and joy. 

**Healing Guidance** You gain a +1 status bonus to all Medicine checks.

**Upwelling of Life** All non-undead creatures gain a +1 status bonus to saves against fear, poison, and disease effects. In addition, when you rest you double the number of hit points you would normally recover.
# &nbsp;
## Coterminous and Remote
-
While Irian is coterminous, the Positive Power and Upwelling of Life properties apply all across Eberron.

When Irian is remote, colours seem to fade and a sense of ennui pervades the world. All creatures take a -1 status penalty to saving throws against fear. In addition, any effect that restores hit points - including spells - only restores half the total.

**Broken Rhythms.** You may not use the same action twice in one turn. If you used a specific action on your previous turn, you take a -2 status penalty to use the action again this turn.

**Fluid in Form.** When a creature casts a transmutation spell, its range is doubled; if that spell has a duration of at least 1 minute but less than 24 hours, the duration is also doubled.

**Embrace the Unknown.** To use the Cast a Spell activity for a 1st level or higher Divination spell, a creature must succeed on a flat check of DC 5 + spell level. On a failed check, the action fails and its spell slot is not expended, but the actions are still consumed. Divination spells cast on other planes can’t affect or target creatures, places, or objects on Kythri.

**The Odds Are Odd.** When you roll a check, you critically succeed if you beat the DC by 5 or more. If you fail the DC by 5 or more, you critically fail instead.

**Constant Change.** Every 24 hours spent in Kythri, some minor or major aspect of your character changes. This could be the colour of your clothing, the colour of your hair, or your gender. This aspect is determined by each player. 

**Chaotic Time.** Time is fluid in Kythri, inconsistent both with the Material Plane and within its islands. When returning to the material plane, a random amount of time has passed.

# &nbsp;
## Manifest Zones
-
Kythri manifest zones are often chaotic in minor or major ways. They may manifest one or more of the planar effects of Kythri, or simply cause the local zone to behave in unpredictable ways such as the sudden change of weather.

**Eternal Shadows.** There is no light in Mabar. Any spell, effect, or other situation that would usually create bright light instead only increases the lighting to dim light.

**Death Triumphant.** Mabar consumes the life force of living things. Every round a living creature spends in
Mabar, it takes 1d6 points of negative damage. If this damage reduces a creature to 0 hit points, it immediately dies and its body crumbles into ash. Natives of Mabar and creatures under the effects of a death ward spell are immune to the effects of this property.

**Empowered Ice.** Cold spells are enhanced, while fire spells are impeded (Gamemastery Guide page 136). When you Cast a Spell with the cold trait, that spell is automatically heightened 1 level, up to a level equal to the highest spell level you can cast.

**Preservation.** When a creature starts its turn with the dying condition, it loses the dying condition and remains unconscious at 0 hit points, increasing the wounded condition as normal. While unconscious at 0 hit points, you enter a state of suspended animation. If an unconscious creature at 0 hit points remains in contact with the ground for more than 1 minute, it’s drawn below the surface and encased in an ice-encrusted stasis. While encased in this way, time ceases to flow for the creature and it doesn’t grow older.

**Stagnation.** When a creature rests, it does not regain any hit points.

**Stillness of Flesh.** Time passes at the same pace as on the Material Plane and is consistent across its layers. However, the passage of time has no effect on a mortal creature’s body, and creatures don’t age or grow while in Risia. Exhaustion, starvation, and disease merely reduce a creature to 0 hit points and do not kill it. Dwarves are immune to this property’s effects, and in Risia they can grow, age, and die, just as they would on the Material Plane.

# &nbsp;
## Manifest Zones
-
A Risia manifest zone typically manifests one or two of the planar effects. In addition, it may have the following additional properties.

**Continual Ice** Bits of ice and snow that will not melt seem to persist throughout the region. These frozen bits do not melt even if they are removed from the region.

**Permafrost** The area is dotted with ice and permafrost, from which mephits and elementals emerge with regularity. Bodies of water are unusually cool even if the surrounding region is hot.

# &nbsp;
## Planar Effects
-
Thelanis is unpredictable, and its cardinal rule is that layers follow their own stories. Consider the following properties.

**Enchanted Realm.** Creatures take a -2 status penalty to saving throws against any spells or abilities with the illusion trait. When a creature casts an illusion spell, its range is doubled; if that spell has a duration of at least 1 minute but less than 24 hours, the duration is also doubled.

**Storybook Logic.** No two layers of Thelanis are exactly alike. While these effects vary from layer to layer, they are entirely reliable within that layer and should feel logical based on the nature of the local story. Damage types could be swapped or rendered impotent, a particular skill could have status bonuses or penalties, or items could behave in unexpected ways. 

**Words Have Power.** In Thelanis, words - and particularly promises - have power. Creatures should be very careful about making formal agreements of any sort, especially with archfey; the more powerful the fey, the graver the consequences of breaking a promise.

**Chaotic Time.** Time is entirely flexible in Thelanis, moving at different rates from layer to layer. While time may have passed faster or slower than expected while in Thelanis, often time catches up with mortals when they return to Eberron - either swiftly ageing them if more time has passed on the Material Plane, or potentially restoring their youth and erasing the decades spent in Thelanis.

**Dangerous Revelations.** Whenever a creature rests for 8 hours or is reduced to 0 hit points, it must make a DC 20 Will saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is exposed to a madness-inducing effect. It may learn a terrible secret, or fundamentally change its vision of reality. The creature becomes Stupefied 1 and may not reduce this value until it escapes this planar effect.

**Time Is an Illusion.** Time is unreliable in Xoriat. Adventurers could be trapped in the Realm of Madness for what feels like a lifetime, then find only a moment has passed on Eberron. It’s even possible for them to return to Eberron before they left.

**Strange Reality.** The things adventurers rely on - gravity, time, their identity itself - aren’t always reliable in Xoriat. These properties frequently change in ways that are near impossible to predict.
