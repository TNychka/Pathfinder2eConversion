**Weaponry** The Ship of the line is loaded to the brim with ship-to-ship weaponsâ€”typically bristling 124-136 with elemental cannons on its first, second, and third tiers. The Price of these weapons is included in that of the Ship of the Line. When building a Ship of the Line, you can choose to replace any of these with other siege weapons with a lower Price. If you want a more expensive siege weapon, you must Craft it separately. Because of the Ship of the Line's structure, any siege weapon in it must launch its payload straight ahead. For instance, a ballista or springald could function in a Ship of the Line, but not a catapult or trebuchet. Crew is typically sufficient to crew these siege weapons.
