## Magebred Animals ((++Magebred animals))
Magebred animals are the result of intensive breeding programs run by House Vadalis. These animals are much like the standard animal, however, they have improved durability, statistics, and abilities. To capture this, apply the Elite template to the base animal statblock (Beastiary pg 6). While Vadalis has a large variety of magebred animals, the animals offered in the Equipment section are the ones primarily available to the public. Others may exist, however, and use the Elite template as the baseline along with any new feature or abilities as a result of their breeding.

## Valenar Animals
These animals are valued creatures of the Tairnadal elves. Valenar animals are thought to be the spiritual descendants of elven druids, cursed to forever remain in their animal form during the elven rebellion against the giants. Typically, a Valenar animal will choose its companion, and this is the only way you can obtain a Valenar animal.

## Magewrights ((++Magewrights))
The magical economy of Eberron is built on the backs of the magewrights: spellcasters who know a handful of cantrips or rituals that allow them to provide vital services. Wizards are exceptional; their ability to prepare any spell with a few hours of study reflects remarkable talent and versatility. By contrast, a magewright knows few spells, but because of their intense focus on those spells, they’re able to cast them in ways others cannot.

### Building Magewrights
Magewrights always cast spells of their profession with the Arcane Ritual Spell feature but can cast cantrips regularly. They own the tools required for their trade, and they are typically higher level in their specialization than their combat challenge. Most magewrights are not trained in combat, and should not be built as such. The following list provides some example magewrights spells and tools for their profession.

##### Example Magewrights
Specialty | Skills and Tools | Cantrips | Spells
--- | :--- | :--- | :---
Artisan | Artisian's Tools, Crafting | Magecraft | Mending
Entertainer | Performance | Halan’s Dramatic Entrance, Tialaen Tongue | Illusory Disguise
Healer | Healer's Tools, Medicine | Stabilize | Heal
Lamplighter | Lamplighter Wand | Kellan’s Kindling, Shol Flame | -
Locksmith | Thieves' Tools, Theivery, Crafting | Magecraft | Lock, Knock
Mediator | Perception, Diplomacy | Guidance | Zone of Truth

## Wandslingers ((++Wandslingers))
As martial magic became widespread in the last war, individuals started training in a new type of fighting: wandslinging. With a cocky bravado, these wandslingers carry a force of personality with a quick wand draw to back it up. Most of these wandslingers specialize in a few, but effective, cantrips cast with the aid of their wand. As this new style of fighting became pronounced in Khorvaire, nations began to see specialist wandslingers wielding the magic of their nation and fighting for their cause.

### Building Wandslingers
Wandslingers are martial characters similar to a gunslinger in spirit - though guns might not exist in your Eberron. A wandslinger typically has 1-2 damaging cantrips and a 1st level damaging spell. Though they call themselves wandslingers, they rarely have access to the types of wands that a player character might. The wands they draw are typically standard arcane foci for casting spells. If creating a higher level wandslinger, consider giving them a magical wand to use instead.
