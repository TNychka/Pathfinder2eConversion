# Gnolls ((++Gnolls))
Powerfully-built humanoids that bear resemblance to hyenas, gnolls are cunning warriors and hunters. Their frightening visage and efficient tactics have given them an ill-starred reputation.
-
)
Gnolls began their existence being bred for and recruited by the overlords of War, Rak Tulkhesh, and the Wild, the Wild Heart. Those who absolved themselves of servitude took their idols to the Znir  - a word that means stone - and destroyed the sculptures of the fiends that kept them bound to violence. All of these clans - warrior, shaman, hunter - vowed that no god, chib, nor demon would hold dominion over them and while their clans differed, they all were of the same pact. These were the ancestors of the Znir Pact gnolls, now found throughout Khorvaire but most prevalently in Droaam. 

## You might...
- Always try to work smarter, not harder.
- Be very physically demonstrative-often hugging, punching, or licking your friends.
- Chew through scraps and bones others would throw away.

## Others Probably...
- Are intimidated by your size, teeth, and eerie laugh.
- Assume that you are dishonourable or worse.
- Respect the brutal efficiency of your hunting style.

## Physical Description...
Gnolls are large, hyena-like humanoids with short muzzles, sharp teeth, and large and expressive round ears. Their bodies are covered in shaggy fur, lighter on the stomach and throat. The colour varies depending on the gnoll, but brown shade—spots and stripes are common. Gnolls typically stand between six and seven feet tall. The women are typically larger and stronger than the males. Gnolls are considered adults at fifteen, and live about 60 years on average.

## Society...
The Znir gnolls include a dozen different clans, each of which holds distinct traditions. All gnolls skillfully hunt and fight, but the Barrakas are known to be the finest trackers of the Pact; the Aryth, the deadliest archers; the Olarune, the strongest warriors and most forceful in the vanguard. Typically, mercenary units are comprised of gnolls of a single clan, assigned based on the nature of the task that lies ahead, and contracts are usually negotiated for a period based on cycles of the clan’s moon.

## Alignment and Religion...
Gnolls have very strong pack instincts and instinctively work together in combat. This means the typical gnoll trends towards a Lawful alignment, but good and evil depend on the current terms of their contract.

## Names...
A Gnoll's most important identifier is its whoop. Impossible for most non-gnolls to properly replicate a whoop, thus gnolls also use contract names. 

### Sample gnoll contract names
Dagnyr, Dhyrn, Ghyrryn, Gnasc, Gnoryc, Gnyrn, Gnyrl, Hyrn, Lhoryn, Lhyr, Lhyrl, Mognyr, Myrl, Sorgnyn, Thyrn, Toryc, Yrgnyn, Yrych

# Gnoll Statistics
Gnolls gameplay statistics, heritages, and additional feats are provided by the Pathfinder 2e Mwangi Expanse book. The following Heritages and feats should be considered an additional pool to pick from in addition to the Pathfinder 2e information already provided.
)
# Gnoll Heritages
You can select one of the following heritage at 1st level to reflect abilities that are representative of the training and development you received while you were raised in a specific clan. These skills and abilities are specialities of your clan, passed down to you from your ancestors. You have only one heritage and can’t change it later. While you must belong to that clan if you pick one of these heritages, any base pathfinder 2e heritages can belong to any clan. The base heritages are not limited to any particular clan, though some clans might have more or fewer members from a particular base heritage. The pathfinder 2e heritages do not count for clan heritage requirements.

working on a weapon or armour, you can grant it the effects of a +1 potency rune until your next daily preparations, gaining a +1 item bonus to attack rolls for a weapon or increasing armour’s item bonus to AC by 1.

**Lharvion** Aberrations of the world are the speciality of your clan, and in particular, the series of blows to best fell one. You become trained in Aberration lore. In addition, if you succeed on a strike against an Aberration, it becomes flat-footed to you until the start of your next turn.

**Nymm** Leadership is what keeps the Znir strong, and you have trained to maximize the potential of yourself and your allies. When you are adjacent to at least one ally, you and adjacent allies gain a +1 circumstance bonus to AC and saving throws. This bonus increases to +2 to Reflex saves against area effects.

**Olarune** You no longer need to take cover to gain the higher bonus from tower shields, instead, you always have the higher bonus. In addition, with your great strength, you can wield tower shields beyond what any other mortal could carry. Anyone may craft tower shields out of any precious material, but only you may wield them due to their great bulk. When crafting a tower shield out of a precious material that is not darkwood, you must have the equivalent value in darkwood (up to the maximum price of the shield). For instance, crafting a standard-grade adamantine tower shield is a total cost of 440 GP with at least 55 GP of adamantine and 55 GP of darkwood.

**Rhaan** The tricks of the fey have become part of your repertoire. You can cast haste and slow as primal innate spells once per day. At 17th level, these are heightened to 7th level.

In addition, once per day you can cast death ward as an occult innate spell.

On a critical success, the creature is revived, loses the dying condition (but remains unconscious), and becomes drained 1 for 1 week. This check can not overcome extraordinary circumstances, such as diseases, curses, or massive damage to the body. After you attempt this special check, the creature becomes immune to it for a week.

**Vult** You can ward off even the eyes that would follow your movements. You gain nondetection as an innate occult spell once per day, which can only be cast on yourself and is automatically heightened to half your level rounded up.

**Zarantyr** Rip and tear until it is done, there is no frequency on rampage, but it gains the flourish trait.
