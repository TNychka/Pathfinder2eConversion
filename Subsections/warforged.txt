# Warforged ((++Warforged))
Trained from the instant they were constructed, until the moment they were deployed, warforged were invented and born for war. As the war came to an end, warforged were recognized and granted their rights as humanoids by the Treaty of Thronehold. Now, they are soldiers whose only purpose has come to an end and must find meaning in a world that has abandoned them.

## Traits
Warforged
Construct

## Living Construct
Your physiological needs are different from those of living creatures. You don't need to eat or drink, but can if you choose to for the effects of consumable spells and magic items. You don't need to sleep, but you still need a daily period of rest. During this period of rest, you must enter a recuperating standby state for at least 2 hours, which is similar to sleeping except you are aware of your surroundings and don't take penalties for being unconscious. Much like with sleeping, if you go too long without entering your standby state, you become fatigued and can't recover until you enter standby for 2 hours.
)
Warforged were created as expendable construct soldiers to fight in the last war.

## You might...
- Have scars and wounds from fighting in the last war, dealing with old injuries and trauma that has never healed
- Often misread other creatures' emotions, struggling to understand their - and your own - feelings
- Apply wartime thinking to every situation, analyzing every situation as a tactical puzzle
 
## Others Probably...
- Believe you do not experience emotions and are incapable of higher thinking beyond your programming
- Are an expendable asset, and to be taken advantage of for your tireless nature and lack of world experience outside the war
- See you as a valuable ally to have on the battlefield, even if sometimes they struggle to relate to you

## Physical Description...
Warforged exterior is covered in a series of flexible metallic or leather plates, creating a form of integrated armour which grants them protection on the battlefield. 

As constructs, warforged typically don't need to breathe, eat, or sleep; however, the body of a warforged needs to vent alchemical impurities at a constant rate. This venting process requires breathable air to prevent a buildup of impurities in a warforged's alchemical fluids which can seize a warforged's biological components, sometimes to fatal effect. Thus, warforged can still suffocate much like living creatures, but can in a limited sense hold their breath as other humanoid creatures can. Though they don't sleep, warforged require a period of restoration to allow the alchemical fluids of their body to replenish. Without this process, a warforged is incapable of fully restoring their body and they enter an inefficient state (similar to a humanoid who doesn't get 8 hours of sleep).

## Society...
Warforged do not have any established cultures or traditions, or any sort of developed place in society.
=
right(
## Living Body
Your body is formed of both wood and steel which by the powers of the creation forge are granted life. This life energy flows through you much like the blood of humanoids. As a result, you are a living creature. You don't have the typical construct immunities, can be affected by effects that target a living creature, and can recover Hit Points normally via positive energy. Additionally, you are not destroyed when reduced to 0 Hit Points. Instead, your life energy attempts to keep you active even in dire straits; you are knocked out and begin dying when reduced to 0 Hit Points.

## Constructed Resistance
Your constructed body has advantages and disadvantages that most humanoid creatures do not. You gain a +1 circumstance bonus to saving throws against diseases and poisons. However, you are considered to be a creature composed entirely of wood and metal for the purposes of magical or other effects - regardless of your integrated armour type. 

## Emotionally Unaware
Warforged find it difficult to understand and express complex emotions. You take a –1 circumstance penalty to Diplomacy, and Performance checks, and on Perception checks to Sense Motive. 
)
## Alignment and Religion...
Warforged tend to be neutrally aligned. Warforged similarly tend to be unreligious. 

## Names...
Most warforged do not have a name for themselves beyond their creation number such as unit 4859. Others come up with a specific name, typically just a single noun or adjective.

### Sample warforged names
Anchor, Banner, Bastion, Blade, Blue, Bow, Cart, Church, Crunch, Crystal, Dagger, Dent, Five, Glaive, Hammer, Iron, Lucky, Mace, Oak, Onyx, Pants, Pierce, Red, Rod, Rusty, Scout, Seven, Shield, Slash, Smith, Spike, Temple, Vault, Wall
  
## Integrated Armor
Your heritage grants you one type of integrated armour, as noted below. If your integrated armour becomes destroyed, it no longer grants an item bonus to your AC but remains integrated into your body. However, your destroyed integrated armour can still be repaired at a very hard DC for its level, losing the destroyed condition when its HP is above 0.

### Nominal Integrated Armour
Your body does not have the armour protections afforded to most other warforged. Though you are still physically wearing integrated armour, you are considered unarmored. Your integrated armour is in the leather armour group and has a Dex cap of +5. This armour has no bulk, but you can never wear other armour or remove your integrated armour; however, you still don't become fatigued from sleeping. Finally, you can etch armour runes onto your armour as normal.

### Light Integrated Armour
Your body is designed to be agile with some protection. Your integrated armour is light armour in the leather armour group that grants a +2 item bonus to AC, a Dex cap of +3, a check penalty of –1, and a Strength value of 12. This armour has no bulk, but you can never wear other armour or remove your integrated armour; however, you still don't become fatigued from sleeping. Finally, you can etch armour runes onto your armour as normal. 

### Medium Integrated Armour
Your body is designed to be particularly resilient. Your integrated armour is medium armour in the plate armour group that grants a +4 item bonus to AC, a Dex cap of +1, a check penalty of –2, a speed penalty of –5 feet, and a Strength value of 16. This armour has no bulk, but you can never wear other armour or remove your integrated armour; however, you still don't become fatigued from sleeping. Finally, you can etch armour runes onto your armour as normal.
=
### Heavy Integrated Armour
Your body is designed to be extremely resilient. Your integrated armour is heavy armour in the plate armour group that grants a +6 item bonus to AC, a Dex cap of 0, a check penalty of –3, a speed penalty of –10 feet, has the Bulwark trait, and a Strength value of 18. This armour has no bulk, but you can never wear other armour or remove your integrated armour; however, you still don't become fatigued from sleeping. Finally, you can etch armour runes onto your armour as normal. 

# Warforged Heritages
You select a heritage at 1st level to reflect abilities passed down to you from your ancestors or common among those of your ancestry in the environment where you were born or grew up. You have only one heritage and can’t change it later. A heritage is not the same as a culture or ethnicity, though some cultures or ethnicities might have more or fewer members from a particular heritage.

## Vanguard Warforged
The primary soldier of the warforged armies of the last war, the Vanguard warforged was the most commonly created of the warforged.

You have medium integrated armour and gain the Weapon Proficiency general feat.

## Juggernaut Warforged
Used as shock troops in the last war, they are a heavier version of the Vanguard Warforged but otherwise have many of the same physical attributes.

You have heavy integrated armour. You gain the Armor Proficiency general feat. 

## Skirmisher Warforged
Designed as lightly armoured but more mobile warforged, the Skirmisher Warforged were widely deployed throughout Khorvaire.

You have light integrated armour and gain the fleet general feat.

## Skilled Warforged heritage
The Skilled Warforged were a creation with both Military and Civilian purposes in mind.

You have nominal integrated armour and become trained in one lore and one common or uncommon language of your choice. At 5th level, you become an expert in the selected lore.

## Living Wand Warforged heritage
The Living Wand Warforged were an attempt at creating a warforged capable of innate spellcraft.

You have nominal integrated armour, and gain one cantrip from the arcane spell list. You can cast this spell as an arcane innate spell at will. A cantrip is heightened to a spell level equal to half your level rounded up.

## Prototype Warforged [Uncommon]
Many prototype warforged throughout the war.

As unique warforged design, work with your GM to figure out what you were created for. Select an integrated armour type, and you become trained in a skill and a 1st level skill feat associated with that skill.

# Alchemical Resistance
## Feat 1
-

# Emotionless
## Feat 1
-

You have turned what some would consider a great weakness into a strength. You gain a +1 circumstance bonus to saving throws against emotion and fear effects. If you roll a success on a saving throw against an emotion or fear effect, you get a critical success instead.

**Enhancement** You have complete physical control over your body, if not always your mind. If you would start your turn confused, controlled, or fleeing due to a failed Will save, you can attempt a Will save against the same DC; on a success, you become paralyzed until your next turn, rather than act against your will.
)
item(
# Integrated Tool
## Feat 1
-
; Warforged
You can integrate toolsets as a direct extension of yourself. You can use a 1-minute activity which has the manipulate trait to integrate a set of tools you own, such as thieves' tools or healer's tools, that weigh a total of 2 Bulk or less into your body. These items count as carried bulk. You can draw or stow this item as an Interact action. Creatures don't automatically see this integrated item when it's stowed and must actively Seek in order to find it. They take a –2 circumstance penalty to any checks to do so. While you are holding the item, it can't be Disarmed and you can't drop or Release it; you must Interact to store the item and free that hand. A creature determined to retrieve the item can do so, but it requires either 1 minute to remove it or extreme violence to you — such as physically removing portions of the limb.
)
=
item(
**Enhancement** Your body has more space for integration, or you have become more adept at using your tools. You can now either integrate two tool kits of 2 bulk or less, or gain a +1 circumstance bonus to a tool kit of your choice when it is integrated into your body.

item(
# Replaceable Integrated Armour
## Feat 1
-
; Warforged
Though it is an extremely uncomfortable process - less painful but akin to a human replacing their skin - you can replace your integrated armour. You can remove the integrated armour that you are wearing, and replace it with any other set of armour. This activity takes 1 hour, and while you replace your armour you are considered unarmoured and flat-footed. When you complete the process, the new armour is incorporated into your body and has no bulk as a result. You can still never wear other armour on top of this armour, and can only have one integrated armour at a time. While this armour is integrated, you don't become fatigued from sleeping in it. As before, you can etch armour runes onto your armour while you are wearing it as normal. 

If you are removing the Integrated Armour from your Heritage, it is considered worthless scrap metal and can only be used as armour if you reincorporate it into your body.

**Enhancement** Your armour becomes more integrated into your body. You gain the Chassis Deflection reaction.

-
; Warforged
You have come to better understand the process that made your body and the magic that powers it. You gain the trained proficiency rank in Arcana and Crafting.

You can use a 1-minute activity, which has the manipulate trait, to integrate a single, one-handed weapon or shield into one of your arms. You can draw or stow this item as an Interact action. Creatures don't automatically see this integrated item when it's stowed and must actively Seek in order to find it. They take a –2 circumstance penalty to any checks to do so. While you are wielding the item, it can't be Disarmed and you can't drop or Release it; you must Interact to store the weapon and free that hand. A creature determined to retrieve the item can do so, but it requires either 1 minute to remove it or extreme violence to your arm—such as physically removing portions of the limb.
