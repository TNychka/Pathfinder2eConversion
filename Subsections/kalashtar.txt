# Kalashtar ((++Kalashtar)) 
Kalashtar are born with a bond to an otherworldly being. They have memories of lives never lived, visions of combat with fiends that they never fought, and the sense of an endless struggle against darkness. For all the pain and suffering in the world, the Kalashtar know that there is a path to light.  Some faceless enemies would hunt all the Kalashtar down and would see their bloodlines eradicated. The Kalashtar's path to light is a dangerous one, as death awaits in the shadows.

) 
The Kalashtar, throughout Khorvaire, are viewed as deeply spiritual people with an other-worldly quality that is hard for many to place. This alien nature is a result of what the Kalashtar are; creatures born from the willing union between humans and quori spirits from the Plane of Dreams, Dal Quor. These Quori spirits are born of the periodic cycles of Dal Quor - which alternate between Light and Dark. As each cycle comes to an end, it is destroyed and reborn as the other. The current phase of Dal Quor is darkness, it is that of il-Lashtavar - also known as the Dreaming Dark. The quori of the Dreaming Dark rule Dal Quor and aim to extend their cycle forever and block out the light to come. However, centuries ago, a handful of quori spirits rejected these machinations and fled from Dal Quor.
Sixty-seven of these rebel spirits escaped into Eberron and found sanctuary in the minds and bodies of Sarlonan monks. These monks are the ancestors of the modern-day Kalashtar. The quori spirits live through the bloodlines of their first hosts, inherited through generations. By maintaining these bloodlines, the mere existence of the Kalashtar is a protest to the evil of the Dreaming Dark and its goals. However, the Dreaming Dark seeks to extinguish these rebel spirits. If they succeed, and a bloodline is terminated, it means the loss of the spirit, and its return into Dal Quor to be reborn and moulded to the Dreaming Dark. 
While most kalashtar quori are one of the original sixty-seven escaped spirits, it is possible for a Kalashtar to join with a Quori spirit who recently abandoned the Dreaming Dark.
As a result of their bonds to their Quori spirit, Kalashtar experience the world differently than other creatures. Their bonded nature enables an aptitude for psionics and greater resistance against psionic attacks. Not only this, but the Kalashtar have an ability to greater influence the emotional domain
|
of their once fiendish quori. The quori represent concepts of nightmares - pride, rage, aggression, deceit - and these concepts were once the source of their power, before turning away from the Dreaming Dark. Now embedded into a Kalashtar, the quori provide their host with a greater understanding of what these emotions are. Coupled with their psionics, Kalashtar can influence the emotional states of their enemies, allies, or even themselves, temporarily. While aptitude in using these skills might vary between Kalashtar, all have the ability to develop and grow their powers through rigorous training and meditation.
Though the Kalashtar are bonded with their Quori, they cannot speak to their quori directly – instead, the relationship is experienced as a sense of inspiration and instinct. Some Kalashtar experience the presence of their quori in the way they feel some emotions more intensely than others; other Kalashtar find they can inspire those around them to feel or fight back against fear, cruelty, or malice.
One of the unique results of the quori flight from Dal Quor is that both the Kalashtar and their Quori spirit are unable to return to Dal Quor when they sleep. Instead, Kalashtar experience a trance state shared with their Quori. This trance enables them to relive moments belonging to the ancestors of their Kalashtar line, and even the memories of their quori before it bonded. The adage of the wise Kalashtar often comes from the fact that in their singular life they hold the experiences of many more.
Throughout the centuries, the machinations of the Dreaming Dark have not yielded, and the evil spirits of Dal Quor still aim to dampen the coming of the Light. For this reason, agents of the Dreaming Dark exist in Khorvaire to eradicate the lineages housing the escaped quori. On the continent of Sarlonna, the Dreaming Dark has taken hostage humans and pose
=
as Inspired, spiritual guides that now lead the Riedran nation. Not all Kalashtar characters are aware of the Dreaming Dark and its connection to Sarlona, but the Dreaming Dark hunts for them all the same.
## You might... 
- Aim to understand the emotions of those around you, even if the situation doesn't call for it. 
- Very rarely consider the limitations you may encounter as you draw up your goals and aspirations. 
- Believe that the rules of reality can be bent like those in dreams. 

## Others Probably... 
- Think you're human, though you move and act in a slightly otherworldly way. 
- Find themselves drawn to your raw charisma, and the otherworldly presence you exhibit.
- Opening their emotions to you, even before they realize they are doing so. 

## Physical Description... 
Kalashtar appear human, but their spiritual connection affects them in a variety of ways. Kalashtar have symmetrical, slightly angular features, and their eyes often glow when they are focused or expressing strong emotions. Beyond this, most creatures struggle to tell Kalshtar and Humans apart at a glance. [52]
## Society... 
There are three main kalashtar societies.
The Adaran Kalashtar live lives most similar to the first monks that opened their arms to the refugee quori spirits. They still live on the continent Sarlona, but belong to the land of Adar. The Empire of Riedra, ruled by agents of the Dreaming Dark, currently dominates Sarlona, and imperial forces endlessly siege Adar. The monks and priests of Adar believe that the war against the Inspired and the Dreaming Dark won’t be won with weapons; instead, prayer and guided meditation will ultimately shift the balance from darkness to light. They believe the Age of Light will come to Dal Quor, and through their passive actions, they sustain their quori and protect it from returning to the Dreaming Dark. Adaran kalashtar rarely take direct action without reason. They are also ascetic, disciplined, and focused on the Path of Light. They are taught to inspire those who live in fear and enlighten those lost to darkness.
|
The Khorvairian kalashtar exist in communities of several major cities of the Five Nations, including the Overlook district in Sharn and Whitewalls in Fairhaven. They prefer to stay close to one another, both to practice their shared traditions and to stand together against any threats posed by the Dreaming Dark. They are familiar with the Path of Light and other kalashtar customs, but there’s no Riedran army at the gates; they know the Dreaming Dark is a threat, but it’s a ghost in the shadows. These kalashtar believe that the Age of Light will be supported through their daily actions, such as showing kindness and compassion or mediating disputes.  
On the other hand, some of the kalashtar of Khorvaire have embraced a grim path in the battle against darkness. The Shadow Watchers don’t believe that evil can be fought merely with kindness and prayer. Members of this order seek to identify sources of corruption and ruthlessly eliminate them. They believe the Age of Light will come when the Darkness is defeated. As such, a Shadow Watcher’s focus is typically on agents of the Dreaming Dark, although they can pursue any force of evil, supernatural or otherwise.
However, your kalashtar might not belong to a community with others of their kind at all. An orphaned kalashtar without spiritual guidance might not be able to understand their trances, the way their quori influences their emotions or the manifestations of their psionic abilities. If your Kalashtar does not know fully what they are, what is their relationship with their unique abilities? [53]
## Alignment and Religion... 
All quori spirits that inhabit the Kalashtar were born of the Dreaming Dark – they represent nightmare qualities, those of rage, deceit, and pride. However, this does not lend Kalashtar to fall easily into evil alignments. These connections can instead result in Kalashtar gaining a greater sense of empathy: understanding the pains of fear, the hubris of pride, and the folly of deceit.
Kalashar, just like the humans they originated from, can have an evil alignment. However, those raised with an understanding of their quori tend to develop positive relationships with the darkness their spirit may represent. However lofty their goals are, they will achieve their motivations in any number of ways, so neither law nor chaos has strong sway over the kalashtar. Most kalashtar are devoted to the Path of Light, and

### Du'ulora Battle Spirit

item( 
# Encouraging Words :a: 
## Feat 1
-
; Auditory, Kalashtar, Linguistic, Mental
**Requirements** The target ally lost hp within the last round.
-
You give an ally within 30 feet a quick boost of encouragement, helping them recover. Attempt a Diplomacy check. The DC is usually the same as a treat wounds check, though the GM might adjust it based on the circumstances. If you have expert proficiency in Diplomacy, you can instead attempt a DC 20 check to increase the Temporary Hit Points recovered by 5; if you have master proficiency, you can attempt a DC 30 check to increase the Temporary Hit Points by 15; if you have legendary proficiency, you can attempt a DC 40 check to increase the Temporary Hit Points by 25.
)
|
item(
No matter the result, the ally is temporarily immune to your Encouraging Words for 1 hour.

**Critical Success** The ally gains 2d8 Temporary Hit Points.

**Success** The ally gains 1d8 Temporary Hit Points.

**Critical Failure** Your words fall flat, the ally is temporarily immune to Encouraging Words for 1 day.

**Special** The temporary hit points gained through this action can never be greater than the total hit points that a creature has lost. If the recipient receives healing which would make the temporary hit points greater than total hit points lost, the temporary hit points from this source are reduced to be equal to total hit points lost.
)
note( 
# Stamina System
Encouraging Words is designed for the stamina system. Keep in mind if you are not using the stamina system, that this feat is an approximation of it. Encouraging Words intends to allow you to keep your allies in the fight longer, but without providing a bonus beyond that. It should not allow "overhealing" as other sources of temporary hit points might allow. 

For example, if your ally has 10 maximum hp and has taken 5 damage: if you succeed on your Encouraging words and roll 8 on 1d8 for temporary hit points, that ally gains 5 temporary hit points. This brings them "back to their maximum hit points", even though some of it is temporary. If they receive 3 points of regular healing after this, they lose 3 temporary hit points as well, maintaining their total of 10. As a result, it is possible to lose all the temporary hit points to healing. 
)
## Tsucora Kalashtar

When you use the Demoralize action, you can instead bend the target's mind to inspire fear. If you do so, Demoralize gains the mental trait rather than the visual trait.  
=
### Tsucora Emancipator
You gain the ability to control and dampen the influence fear has over you, and your allies. Allies under the effect of your Link Minds gain a +1 status bonus to their saves against effects with the Fear trait.
