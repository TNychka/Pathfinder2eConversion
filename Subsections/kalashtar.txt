# Kalashtar ((++Kalashtar)) 
Kalashtar are born with a bond to an otherworldly being. They have memories of lives never lived, visions of combat with fiends that they never fought, and the sense of an endless struggle against darkness. For all the pain and suffering in the world, the Kalashtar know that there is a path to light.  Some faceless enemies would hunt all the Kalashtar down and would see their bloodlines eradicated. The Kalashtar's path to light is a dangerous one, as death awaits in the shadows.

The hashalaq quori is a force that feeds on doubt and desire. You can choose one of the following paths.  
### Hashalaq Seducer

### Kalaraq Supporter 
If you are using the stamina variant rules, you gain the Encouraging Words skill feat (even without meeting the level prerequisites). Otherwise, you gain the following Encouraging Words action. 
item( 
# Encouraging Words :a: 
## Feat 1
-
; Auditory, Kalashtar, Linguistic, Mental
**Requirements** The target ally lost hp within the last round.
-
You give an ally within 30 feet a quick boost of encouragement, helping them recover. Attempt a Diplomacy check. The DC is usually the same as a treat wounds check, though the GM might adjust it based on the circumstances. If you have expert proficiency in Diplomacy, you can instead attempt a DC 20 check to increase the Temporary Hit Points recovered by 5; if you have master proficiency, you can attempt a DC 30 check to increase the Temporary Hit Points by 15; if you have legendary proficiency, you can attempt a DC 40 check to increase the Temporary Hit Points by 25.
)
|
item(
No matter the result, the ally is temporarily immune to your Encouraging Words for 1 hour.

**Critical Success** The ally gains 2d8 Temporary Hit Points.

**Success** The ally gains 1d8 Temporary Hit Points.

**Critical Failure** Your words fall flat, the ally is temporarily immune to Encouraging Words for 1 day.

**Special** The temporary hit points gained through this action can never be greater than the total hit points that a creature has lost. If the recipient receives healing which would make the temporary hit points greater than total hit points lost, the temporary hit points from this source are reduced to be equal to total hit points lost.
)
note( 
# Stamina System
Encouraging Words is designed for the stamina system. Keep in mind if you are not using the stamina system, that this feat is an approximation of it. Encouraging Words intends to allow you to keep your allies in the fight longer, but without providing a bonus beyond that. It should not allow "overhealing" as other sources of temporary hit points might allow. 

For example, if your ally has 10 maximum hp and has taken 5 damage: if you succeed on your Encouraging words and roll 8 on 1d8 for temporary hit points, that ally gains 5 temporary hit points. This brings them "back to their maximum hit points", even though some of it is temporary. If they receive 3 points of regular healing after this, they lose 3 temporary hit points as well, maintaining their total of 10. As a result, it is possible to lose all the temporary hit points to healing. 
)
