## Kalashtar ((+Kalashtar))
Kalashtar are born with a bond to an otherworldly being. They have memories of lives never lived, visions of combat with fiends that they never fought, and the sense of an endless struggle against darkness. For all the pain and suffering in the world, the Kalashtar know that there is a path to light.  Some faceless enemies would hunt all the Kalashtar down and would see their bloodlines eradicated. The Kalashtar's path to light is a dangerous one, as death awaits in the shadows.
-
)
The kalashtar are a compound people, created from the union of humanity and renegade spirits from the plane of dreams — spirits called quori. Kalashtar are often seen as wise, spiritual people with great compassion for others. There is an unmistakable alien quality to the kalashtar, though, as they are haunted by the conflicts of their otherworldly spirits.

Every kalashtar has a connection to a spirit of light, a bond shared by other members of their bloodline. Kalashtar can’t directly communicate with their quori spirits. Rather, they might experience this relationship as a sense of instinct and inspiration, drawing on the memories of the spirit when they dream. This connection grants kalashtar minor psionic abilities, as well as protection from psychic attacks. All of these quori dream spirits are virtuous, but some are warriors and others are more contemplative. Typically, a kalashtar knows the name and nature of their spirit, but some may know nothing of their spirit or the source of their psychic gifts, such as an orphan kalashtar raised among strangers. [7]

## You might...
- Try to understand the motives and feelings of your allies, and even your enemies.
- Encourage others to dream a little bigger, and set lofty goals to achieve. 
- Apply dream logic to mundane situations.

## Others Probably...
- Think you're human, though you move and act in a slightly otherworldly way.
- Find themselves drawn to the wisdom you display, which seems beyond your years.
- Opening their emotions to you, even before they realize they are doing so.

## Physical Description...
Kalashtar appear human, but their spiritual connection affects them in a variety of ways. Kalashtar have symmetrical, slightly angular features, and their
|
eyes often glow when they are focused or expressing strong emotions. [7]
## Society...
There are three main kalashtar societies. 

The Adaran kalashtar were born in Sarlona, in the distant land of Adar. Today, the Empire of Riedra dominates Sarlona, and imperial forces endlessly siege Adar. The monks and priests of Adar believe that the war against the Inspired and il-Lashtavar won’t be won with weapons; instead, prayer and guided meditation will ultimately shift the balance from darkness to light. Adaran kalashtar rarely take direct action without reason. Adaran kalashtar are ascetic, disciplined, and focused on the Path of Light. They are taught to inspire those who live in fear and enlighten those lost to darkness.

The khorvairian kalashtar exist in communities of several major cities of the Five Nations, including the Overlook district in Sharn and Whitewalls in Fairhaven. They prefer to stay close to one another, both to practice their shared traditions and to stand together against any threats posed by the Dreaming Dark. They are familiar with the Path of Light and other kalashtar customs. But there’s no Riedran army at the gates; they know the Dreaming Dark is a threat, but it’s a ghost in the shadows. These kalashtar simply seek to spread light through their daily actions, such as showing kindness and compassion or mediating disputes. 
On the other hand, some of the kalashtar of Khorvaire have embraced a grim path in the battle against darkness. The Shadow Watchers don’t believe that evil can be fought merely with kindness and prayer. Members of this order seek to identify sources of corruption and ruthlessly eliminate them. While a Shadow Watcher’s focus is on agents of the Dreaming Dark, they can pursue any force of evil, supernatural or otherwise. [8]

)

## Alignment and Religion...
While kalashtar can be evil - the communities they are raised in and the light quori that has selected them inclines them towards good. However lofty their goals are, they will achieve their motivations in any number of ways, neither law nor chaos has strong sway over the kalashtar.

Most kalashtar are devoted to the Path of Light, and though its faithful worship no gods, the faith itself can be a source of divine magic.

## Names...
A kalashtar name adds a personal prefix to the name of the quori spirit within the kalashtar. Such names have no relation to the kalashtar’s gender.

Kalashtar orphans are unlikely to know the name of their spirit and take names from another source.

# Kalashtar Heritages
The abilities and the personalities of kalashtar are heavily influenced by their quori spirit. Choose one of the following kalashtar heritages at 1st level.

## Du'ulora Kalashtar
The fiendish du'ulora spirit drives your rage and aggression. How you channel this spirit's energy in your daily life is up to you, but you have developed the ability to unleash it on your enemies. You gain the Phantom Pain spell which you can cast as an occult innate spell once per day.
=
**Special** If at any point you gain access to the Moment of Clarity feat through class or archetype, you automatically gain it from this heritage.

## Hashalaq Kalashtar
The hashalaq quori is a force that feeds on doubt and desire. You can choose one of the following paths. 
### Hashalaq Seducer
You become trained in Diplomacy (or another skill if you were already trained in Diplomacy). You gain the Group Impression skill feat. In addition, when you make a group impression you can increase the number of targets by half rounded up.
### Hashalaq Insightful
You become trained in Deception (or another skill if you were already trained in Deception). You gain the Lie to Me skill feat. In addition, you gain a +2 circumstance bonus against any attempt to lie to you.
### Hashalaq Deciever 
You become trained in Deception (or another skill if you were already trained in Deception). You gain the Charming Liar skill feat. In addition, you gain a +1 circumstance bonus to your deception checks.
## Kalaraq Kalashtar
Kalaraq are the natural leaders of the quori, spirits of pride and ambition. Though rarest of the kalashtar spiritual lineages, you depend on your allies as they depend on you. You become trained in Diplomacy (or another skill if you were already trained in Diplomacy). 

If you are using the stamina variant rules, you gain the Encouraging Words skill feat (even without meeting the level prerequisites) and a +1 circumstance bonus when you use the feat.

Otherwise, you gain the following action.
item(
# Encouraging Words :a:
## Feat 1
-
; Auditory, Kalashtar, Linguistic, Mental
**Requirements** The target ally lost hp within the last round
-
You give an ally within 30 feet a quick boost of encouragement, helping them recover. Attempt a Diplomacy check. The DC is usually the same as a treat wounds check, though the GM might adjust it based on the circumstances. If you have expert proficiency in Diplomacy, you can instead attempt a DC 20 check to increase the Temporary Hit Points recovered by 5; if you have master proficiency, you can attempt a DC 30 check to increase the Temporary Hit Points by 15; if you have legendary proficiency, you can attempt a DC 40 check to increase the Temporary Hit Points by 25.   

No matter the result, the ally is temporarily immune to your Encouraging Words for 1 hour.

**Critical Success** The ally gains 2d8 Temporary Hit Points.

**Success** The ally gains 1d8 Temporary Hit Points.

**Critical Failure** Your words fall flat, the ally is temporarily immune to Encouraging Words for 1 day.

**Special** The Temporary Hit Points gained through this action can never add up to be greater than the total Hit Points that a creature has lost. If the recipient receives additional healing, the temporary hit points from this source are reduced by an equal amount to maintain this balance.
)
=
note(
# The Stamina System

Encouraging Words is designed for the stamina system. Keep in mind if you are not using the stamina system, that this feat is an approximation of it. Encouraging Words intends to allow you to keep your allies in the fight longer, but without providing a bonus beyond that. It should not allow "overhealing" as other sources of temporary hit points might allow.

For example, if your ally has 10 maximum hp and has taken 5 damage: if you succeed on your Encouraging words and roll 8 on 1d8 for temporary hit points, that ally gains 5 temporary hit points. This brings them "back to their maximum hit points", even though some of it is temporary. If they receive 3 points of regular healing after this, they lose 3 temporary hit points as well, maintaining their total of 10. As a result, it is possible to lose all the temporary hit points to healing.
)

## Tsucora Kalashtar
The tsucora are the quori of classic nightmares, feeding on terror. You become trained in intimidation (or another skill if you were already trained in intimidation) and gain the Intimidating Glare feat. When you use the Demoralize action, you can instead project nightmares into the target's mind. If you do so, Demoralize gains the mental trait rather than the visual trait.

# Ancestry Feats
