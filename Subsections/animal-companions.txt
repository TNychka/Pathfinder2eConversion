# Animal Companions
Throughout the land of Eberron, brave adventurers are often accompanied by fierce and loyal companions. These companions come in many forms, from the majestic dinosaurs ridden by halflings, to the powerful constructs crafted to assist in tasks and guard their masters. These companions are not just allies in battle, but they also provide a sense of companionship and connection to the natural world. In Eberron, a trusty companion is not just a luxury, it's a necessity for any adventurer looking to make their mark on the world.
