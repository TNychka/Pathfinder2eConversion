# Shifters ((++Shifters))
Shifters are an ancestry decended from humans and natural werecreatures. Shifters cannot completely change like their were-counterparts, but can shift to take on the features of the animal inherent to their bloodline. From this animal a Shifters gains extraordinary abilities, such as deadly fangs, refined senses, speed, and other such traits.
-
)
Shifters are a diverse ancestry that combine the traits of their human and animal blood, not unlike a werecreature. With the ability to draw on their inherent animal to temporarily shift into a more feral version of themselves, they are sometimes also referred to as the weretouched. Shifters are no longer related to the werecreatures or humans that are believed to have started the ancestry, and have become their own ancestry with a unique cultures and traditions. Despite the large distinction between Shifters and Werecreatures, the similarities between the two lead to their persecution during the fifty-year crusade against werecreatures less than two centuries ago. Since then, most shifters across Khorvaire prefer to live in enclaves or districts of other shifters.

## You might...
- Prefer the companionsip of other shifters, or a close group of friends
- Feel strong emotions, typically manifesting in the spirit of your inherent animal
- View survival as a challenge, and strive to be self-reliant, adaptable, and resourceful

## Others Probably...
- Assume that you have a natural connection to animals and the natural world. Especially that of your inherent animal.
- Worry that you can't control yourself and may give in to your feral instincts to attack others, especially when the moon is full.
- Have difficulty relating to the strong emotions you can feel.

## Physical Description...
Shifters are humanoid in shape, but their were-ancestry gives shifters a distinctly lithe form compared to humans. While walking, shifters tend to move in springs and leaps rather than simply. Their faces and bodies typically show traits of their inherent animal, such as longer fangs, pointed ears, feline eyes, or other such features. Their bodies - especially their legs and forearms - are typically covered in more hair than a human, bordering on a fur like covering. They typically stand using only the front of their clawed feet, creating a bordering a digitigrade stance.
|
A Shifters' inherent animal is more obvious when they are transformed into their hybrid shape, their features shifting to resemble the animal to which they are connected. The manifestation of these features varies from shifter to shifter, but typically, their teeth become more prominent, their skin toughens like hide, their hair lengthens, and their eyes reshape.

## Society...
Shifters are a relatively uncommon race in Khorvaire. There are two primary types of shifter communities. The first type of community is common in the remote woods of the Eldeen Reaches, and the other is common to the enclaves many shifters form throughout Khorvaire in major cities. 

The communities of the deep forests of the Eldeen Reaches are typically formed out of a desire to be free of the control of nations and other ancestries. The communities are frequently nomadic hunter-gatherer tribes, and primarily shifter composition as a result of shifters preferring to bond with fellow shifters. Here the culture and traditions of the shifter communities are strongest, as the shifter community strongly bonds with one another.

Shifter communities of the enclaves of major cities are done partially as a way for the community to hold on to their culture and traditions. As the minority in many of these regions, shifters that integrate with the community outside their enclaves struggle to hold on to the culture and traditions of their upbringing. 

While the shifter parents are dedicated to raising their children, the family structure is different from many other ancestries. Shifter children typically form a strong bond with a few other children around their age group. Though the children in these groups are typically from many different families, this initial bond is often the strongest bond that a shifter forms in their life.

## Alignment and Religion...
Shifters are typically neutral, and view the world as a strugle to survive. The moral and ethical concerns of a shifter are typically centred around the well-being of those directly around them. However, shifters are as varied in alignment as they are in inherent animal and can inclined to any alignment.

After the silver purge, shifters have become suspicious of any outside religion. Having seen how a religion can motivate people, they view intense or conflict-prone religions as terrifying forces capable of causing great harm. As a result, shifters' own religions are typically varied and less intense than many would expect of their culture. 
Many shifters follow some form of druidic worship. The most common druidic worship of shifters is that of the order of druids known as the moonspeakers. These moonspeakers draw meaning from the movements of the moons, and believe that the moons influence over their werecreature heritage gives the moons great power over shifters.
Other shifters who reside in the major cities of Khorvaire have taken up worship of the local religion. Many shifters in the urban centres of Khorvaire revere Balinor and Boldrei of the Sovreign Host, and many shifter adventurers revere the ways of the Traveller of the Dark Six.
During the silver purge, some shifters adopted the faith of the Silver Flame and participated in the crusade. Some shifters still remain active in the church of the silver flame, though to much scorn of other shifters.

## Names...
Shifters typically take on names similar to that of humans, or that of the community around them though with a more rustic incination. Shifters typically have a personal name that they use with their friends, and a wandering name that they use with strangers.

### Sample names
Aethelwulf, Bennin, Bree, Burch, Dominic, Erylis, Geth, Karmos, Lorelai, Lyndra, Taria, Volante
### Sample wandering names
Ash, Aurora, Autumn, Brook, Claw, Cliff, Dawn, Flint, Frost, Hazel, Iris, Lily, Rain, River, Rose, Rock, Thorn, Torn, Storm, Summer
