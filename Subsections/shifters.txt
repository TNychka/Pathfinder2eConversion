# Shifters ((++Shifters))
Shifters are an ancestry descended from humans and natural werecreatures. Shifters cannot completely change like their were-counterparts but can shift to take on the features of the animal inherent to their bloodline. From this animal, a shifter gains extraordinary abilities, such as deadly fangs, refined senses, speed, and other such traits.
-
)
Shifters are a diverse ancestry that combines the traits of their human and animal heritage, not unlike a were-creature. With the ability to draw on their inherent animal to temporarily shift into a more feral version of themselves, they are sometimes also referred to as the were-touched. Shifters are no longer related to either of these distant ancestors and have become a distinct ancestry with unique cultures and traditions. Despite the large distinction between shifters and werecreatures, shifters were persecuted during the fifty-year crusade against werecreatures less than two centuries ago. Since then, most shifters across Khorvaire prefer to live in enclaves or districts of other shifters -avoiding other ancestries which may still bear them ill will.

## You might...
- Prefer the companionship of other shifters or a close group of friends.
- Feel strong emotions, typically manifesting in the spirit of your inherent animal.
- View survival as a challenge, and strive to be self-reliant, adaptable, and resourceful.

## Others Probably... 
- Assume that you have a natural connection to animals and the natural world. Especially that of your inherent animal. 
- Worry that you can't control yourself and may give in to your feral instincts to attack others, especially when the moon is full. 
- Have difficulty relating to the strong emotions you can feel. 

## Physical Description... 
Shifters are humanoid in shape, but their were-ancestry gives shifters a distinctly lithe form compared to humans. While travelling, shifters tend to move in springs and leaps rather than simply walking alongside their humanoid companions. Their faces and bodies typically show traits of their inherent animal, such as longer fangs, pointed ears, feline eyes, and other such features. Their bodies -especially their legs and forearms -are typically covered in more hair than
|
a human, creating a fur-like covering over their limbs. 
A shifter's stance is typically upright with their weight placed on only the front of their clawed feet, creating a semi-digitigrade look. 

A Shifters' inherent animal is more obvious when they are transformed into their hybrid shape, their features shifting to resemble the animal to which they are connected. The manifestation of these features varies from shifter to shifter, but typically, their teeth become more prominent, their skin toughens like hide, their hair lengthens, and their eyes reshape. 

## Society... 
Shifters are a relatively uncommon race in Khorvaire, it is said that there are more changelings in Breland than there are shifters in all of Khorvaire. Yet, the shifters who live throughout Khorvaire have formed tight-knit communities. There are two primary types of shifter communities. The first type of community is a nomadic tribal hunter-gather pack, common in the remote woods of the Eldeen Reaches. The other is common in urban centres where shifters form small enclaves of other shifters to hold on to their traditions and remain with those who understand their ways. 

The communities of the deep forests of the Eldeen Reaches are typically formed out of a desire to be free of the control of nations and other ancestries. These communities are frequently nomadic hunter-gatherer tribes and are primarily composed of shifters. While it is not unheard of to have other ancestries present in a tribe, shifters typically tend to prefer to bond with fellow shifters. Here the culture and traditions of the shifter communities are strongest, as the shifter community cooperates for the good of one another and the survival of the community. 

Shifter communities of the enclaves of major cities typically form as a result of shifters desire to hold on to their culture and traditions. As the minority in many of these urban regions, without these tight-knit groups shifters struggle to hold on to the culture and traditions of their upbringing.

)

While the shifter parents are dedicated to raising their children, the family structure is different from many other ancestries. Shifter children typically form a strong bond with a few other children around their age group. Though the children in these groups are typically from many different families, this initial bond is often the strongest bond that a shifter forms in their life. 

## Alignment and Religion... 
Shifters are typically neutral and view the world as a struggle to survive. The moral and ethical concerns of a shifter are typically centred around the well-being of those directly around them. However, shifters are as varied in alignment as they are in the animals that they draw ancestry from, and can be inclined to any alignment. 

After the silver crusade, shifters have become suspicious of any outside religion. Having seen how religion can motivate people, they view intense or conflict-prone religions as terrifying forces capable of causing great harm. As a result, shifters' religions are typically varied and less intense than many would expect of their culture.  
Many shifters follow some form of druidic worship. The most common druidic worship of shifters is that of the order of druids known as the moonspeakers. These moonspeakers draw meaning from the movements of the moons and believe that the moon's influence over their were-creature heritage gives the moons great power over shifters. 
Other shifters who reside in the major cities of Khorvaire have taken up worship of the local religion. Many shifters in the urban centres of Khorvaire revere Balinor and Boldrei of the Sovereign Host, and many shifter adventurers revere the ways of the Traveller of the Dark Six. 
During the silver purge, some shifters adopted the faith of the Silver Flame and participated in the crusade. There are still shifters active in the church of the silver flame, though to much scorn of other shifters. 

## Names... 
Shifters typically take on names similar to that of humans, or that of the community around them though with a more rustic inclination. Shifters typically have a personal name that they use with their friends and a wandering name that they use with strangers. 

### Sample names 
Aethelwulf, Bennin, Bree, Burch, Dominic, Erylis, Geth, Karmos, Lorelai, Lyndra, Taria, Volante 
### Sample wandering names

Shifters are renowned for their ability like humans, to persist through the most gruelling of trials. When you would become fatigued, attempt a DC 17 flat check. On a success, you aren't fatigued. If the fatigued condition has an underlying cause that you don't address, such as lack of rest, you must attempt the check again at an interval determined by the GM until you fail the flat check or address the underlying cause.

**Special** If you have the beasthide or gorebrute heritage, you gain a +1 status bonus to your checks against becoming fatigued.
