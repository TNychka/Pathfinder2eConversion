# Religions ((+Religions))
Without the presence of physically manifesting gods, Eberron is a world of diverse religions and faith in the higher powers. Many different religions have formed in the different cultures of the world, each following a unique faith. These many diverse religions draw their divine power from the strength of their faith, rather than drawing it as a gift of a divine source.

)
Anyone can worship a deity, but those who do so devoutly draw divine power from the strength of their faith. Each deity below has a short description, followed by their alignment, edicts, anathemas, and devotee benefits. In Eberron, you are not required to fit exactly into your deity's alignments, edicts, or anathemas. As a devout follower of the faith, you may follow a lawful good sovereign, but be chaotic evil in nature. Similarly, if you break the Edicts and Anathemas of your diety, divine retribution is unlikely - though you may still draw the ire of your church. If you do so break these guidelines, it is up to you to explain how this difference came to be, and how you resolve this as a divine follower.

# The Sovereign Host [NG] ((++The Sovereign Host))
-

The Sovereign Host consists of the deities most commonly worshipped by the majority of Khorvaire’s population. Most people revere the Host as a whole pantheon, offering prayers to different deities in different situations. Even clerics are often devoted to the entire Host rather than to a specific patron. If you are a cleric of the sovereign host, you may take divine font, abilities, skills, domains, spells, edicts, anathemas, or favoured weapons of your worship from any Sovereign. However once you have selected one of these sources, you may not mix further increases (such as in the case of cleric spells at 1st, 3rd and 5th level). The pantheon is neutral good, and its favoured weapon is the longsword-the weapon of its martial champion, Dol Dorn.
