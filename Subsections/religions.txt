# Religions ((+Religions))
Without gods manifesting their presence in the world of Eberron, many different religions have formed in the different cultures of the world. These many diverse religions draw their divine power from the strength of their faith, rather than drawing it from the gift of a divine source. The clerics and paladins of the world choose one of these faiths to champion.
-
)
Anyone can worship a deity, but those who do so devoutly should take care to pursue the faith’s edicts (behaviours the faith encourages) and avoid its anathemas (actions considered blasphemous). Each deity below has a short description, followed by their alignment, edicts, anathemas, and devotee benefits. In Eberron, you are not required to fit exactly into your deity's alignments, and you may follow a lawful good sovereign, but be a chaotic evil character. If you do so break the mould, it is up to you to explain how this difference came to be. Though you may still receive the powers of your faith if you don't meet the alignment of your faith, this may still make you an enemy of their other followers.

## The Sovereign Host  ((++The Sovreign Host))
The Sovereign Host consists of the deities most commonly worshipped by the majority of Khorvaire’s population. Most people revere the Host as a whole pantheon, offering prayers to different deities in different situations. Even clerics are often devoted to the entire Host rather than to a specific patron. If you are a cleric of the sovereign host, you may take divine font, abilities, skills, domains, spells, edicts, anathemas, or favoured weapons of your worship from any Sovereign. However once you have selected one of these sources, you may not mix further increases (such as in the case of cleric spells at 1st, 3rd and 5th level). Taken as a whole, the pantheon is neutral good, and its favoured weapon is the longsword—the weapon of its martial champion, Dol Dorn.

### Arawai : Goddess of Agriculture
A deity of fertility, plant life, and abundance, Arawai is neutral good. She claims many druids and rangers among her followers, as well as farmers, sailors, and any who are significantly concerned with weather or fertility. She is usually portrayed as a half-elf woman,

## The Dark Six  ((++The Dark Six))
In some ways, the Dark Six can be considered a part of the pantheon of the Sovereign Host. It would be more accurate, however, to say that these deities have been cast out of the pantheon because of their evil ways. The Dark Six are the patrons of criminals, outcasts, and villains, as well as of various kinds of monsters. The holy texts show them scheming against the Sovereign Host at every turn for reasons that vary from deity to deity, and their dark minions likewise plot against the followers of the Sovereign Host.
=
### The Devourer
The Devourer is the tsunami that overwhelms the tallest ship, the wildfire that consumes the grandest castle, the earthquake that levels the most glorious city. He is the vast and primordial power of nature, a force that will break any chain and wear down the strongest wall. 
Those who embrace the Devourer celebrate the glorious power of the wilds. They revel in the raging storm and gladly embrace their predatory instincts. They accept that nature is often bloody and cruel, and don’t hesitate to follow its example. But while it may be harsh, nature is rarely evil. Priests of the Devourer often urge their parishioners to follow their instincts or teach people to live in accord with nature instead of forcing their will upon it. 
**Areas of Concern** Devastation, hunger, nautical travel, storms, water
**Alignment** NE
**Divine Font** Harm
**Divine Ability** Strength or Constitution
**Divine Skill** Nature
**Domains** Change, Cold, Decay, Destruction, Dust, Lightning, Nature, Plague, Void, Water
**Cleric Spells** 1st: gust of wind, 3rd: lightning bolt, 5th: control water
**Edicts** Embrace the glorious power of the wilds, live free of social or materialistic chains, cause destruction when angered
**Anathema** bring civilization to intrude on the wild, become civilized
**Favoured Weapon** Trident

### The Fury
The Fury is a silent whisper that can drive you to doubt or despair. She is reckless rage and an all-consuming passion. Instinct is the voice of the Fury, guiding us when rational thought fails. And she is the Sovereign of revenge, promising vengeance to those willing to surrender to her. Her father the Devourer embodies the devastating power of the storm outside us; the Fury is the storm that rages within us, the wild emotions we fight to control. Revered by those whose passion consumes their lives, she is commonly portrayed as a half-elf, sometimes as a drow, and occasionally as a snakelike wyrm of Khyber. 
**Areas of Concern** Anger, extremism, insanity, passion, revenge
**Alignment** NE
**Divine Font** Harm
**Divine Ability** Strength or Dexterity
**Divine Skill** Intimidation
|

**Edicts** Convey yourself with regal dignity, claim what you desire and deserve, seek vengeance from those who wrong you
**Anathema** Allow a slight to go unanswered, show humility or fear
**Favoured Weapon** Rapier

### The Keeper
The Keeper is the patron of those who put personal gain above all else. He guides those who use guile to gain gold, regardless of the cost to others. A rogue who invokes Olladra sees themselves as the hero of the story; one who calls on the Keeper has no compunctions about being the villain. Beyond guiding those who place profit before all else, the Keeper is also known for his willingness to make deals—though his bargains are always slanted in his favour. He is portrayed as a gaunt or grossly fat human, as a lich or a ghoul, or sometimes as a skeletal dragon. 
**Areas of Concern** Death, entropy, greed, hunger, time
**Alignment** NE
**Divine Font** Harm
**Divine Ability** Strength or Charisma 
**Divine Skill** Theivery

**Edicts** Gain financial control over others, gather new wealth, count your riches
**Anathema** Allow honour or tradition to prevent you from taking what you want
**Favoured Weapon** Scythe


### The Mockery
Others who follow the Mockery assert that the very idea of honour in war is delusional. Pain, terror, and death are the inevitable results of violence; at least those who follow the Mockery acknowledge the truth others deny. The assassin who kills without warning, the barbarian who sees mercy as a weakness, the pirate who cultivates a terrifying reputation—all these might view the Mockery as an ally. He is portrayed as a ghastly human warrior with the skin stripped from his body, cloaked in the skins of his enemies, and
=
sometimes as a half-fiend red dragon. 
**Areas of Concern** Combat, dishonour, murder, terror, treachery.
**Alignment** NE
**Divine Font** Harm
**Divine Ability** Dexterity or Charisma 
**Divine Skill** Deception

**Edicts** Seize any opportunity that would benefit you, solve your problems With Violence, hide your true intentions
**Anathema** Beg for help or mercy, let a slight go unanswered
**Favoured Weapon** Kama

### The Shadow
The Shadow, the literal shadow of Aureon, gained a life of its own as the price of his arcane mastery. Chaotic Evil, the Shadow devotes its energy to dark magic and the corruption of nature. Many evil wizards and sorcerers revere the Shadow, and many of the monsters of Droaam invoke its name as well. It is usually depicted as a shadow, but sometimes (particularly in Droaam) as a shadow dragon. 
**Areas of Concern**  Arcane magic, consequence, corruption, darkness, duality
**Alignment** NE
**Divine Font** Harm
**Divine Ability** Constitution or Intelligence 
**Divine Skill** Arcana

**Edicts** Learn and hoard forbidden magic, steal secrets from others
**Anathema** Destroy forbidden lore, reveal the entirety of a secret
**Favoured Weapon** staff
|
### The Traveler
The most mysterious of the Dark Six, the Traveler is chaotic neutral and seems to have no connection to the other deities of the pantheon. A consummate shapeshifter, the Traveler is said to walk the land in a thousand disguises. A master of cunning and deception, it emphasizes subtlety and careful planning. In some places, the Traveler is known as the Giver of Gifts, but proverbs warn, “Beware the gifts of the Traveler.” Revered by doppelgangers, lycanthropes, and a number of changelings and shifters. 
**Areas of Concern** Chaos, deception, evolution, invention, transformation
**Alignment** CN
**Divine Font** Heal, Harm
**Divine Ability** Dexterity or Wisdom

**Edicts** Live life freely, manipulate dangerous beings and opportunities to your benefit, thrive in hostile conditions
**Anathema** Refuse a reasonable bet, let social pressure change your behaviour
**Favoured Weapon** scimitar

## The Silver Flame
In a world where deadly supernatural evil is a concrete fact of existence, the Church of the Silver Flame is dedicated to protecting the common people against supernatural forces of evil. The church itself was founded when a noble paladin gave her life to pull her nation back from the abyss. Some might mistakenly see the church merely as a militant hierarchical religious organization and assume that it must be a force of oppression. But while the Church of the Silver Flame is a religion, it’s equally a volunteer militia whose members are prepared to risk their lives to protect every innocent from the real and deadly threats lurking in the shadows. 
**Areas of Concern** Protection, Defence of the Innocents, Destruction of supernatural evil
**Alignment** LG
**Divine Font** Heal
**Divine Ability** Wisdom or Charisma

**Cleric Spells** 1st: anticipate peril, 3rd: fireball, 4th: fire shield
**Edicts** free others from oppression, release harmful tethers be they physical or spiritual, work toward your best self and inspire others to follow
**Anathema** allow tyrants to escape punishment after their reign ends, enslave or oppress others, prevent others from honestly expressing themselves
**Favoured Weapon** longbow

## The Blood of Vol  ((++The Blood of Vol))
Most followers of the Blood of Vol identify as Seekers of the Divinity Within—usually shortened to Seekers—though there are other traditions within the faith. The Blood of Vol has long been vilified, with outsiders often viewing it as a death cult, falsely equating it with the cult of Katashka the Gatekeeper, or blaming its members for plagues and blights. However, in the eyes of the Seeker, life and the soul are both divine forces. Every soul has the potential to evolve and develop divine power—but this takes time and willpower, and
|
most mortals die before they accomplish it. 
**Areas of Concern** Death, Undead, and Ambition
**Alignment** LN
**Divine Font** Harm
**Divine Ability** Constitution or Intelligence
**Divine Skill** Occultism
**Domains** Ambition, Change, Confidence, Death, Decay, Duty, Knowledge, Magic, Pain, Perfection, Protection, Repose, Secrecy, Soul, Undeath, Vigil
**Cleric Spells** 1st animate dead, 3rd: haste, 6th: dominate
**Edicts** Strive to unlock the potential within yourself, encourage others to strive toward their potential for greatness
**Anathema** sacrifice your life, fail to work toward goals or grow in skill, relax excessively or give in to sloth, blemish a soul
**Favoured Weapon** dagger

## The Path of Light  ((++The Path of Light))
The kalashtar of Adar follow no deity, but they do revere a universal force of positive energy they call il-Yannah, or “the Great Light. Most followers of the Path of Light are psions and psychic warriors, seeking to perfect their bodies and minds through meditation and communion with this light to prepare themselves for conflict with the forces of darkness — most particularly, the Dreaming Dark of the Inspired of Riedra. 
**Areas of Concern** Dreams, the path of light
**Alignment** LN
**Divine Font** Heal
**Divine Ability** Dexterity or Wisdom
**Divine Skill** Diplomacy
**Domains** Change, Dreams, Freedom, Knowledge, Perfection, Protection, Repose

**Favoured Weapon** Fist
=
## The Spirits of the Past ((++The Spirits of the Past))
The elves of Aerenal revere their ancient dead as incarnate deities, seeking advice from deathless councillors and petitioning their favour. Unlike undead creatures, the deathless elves of the Undying Court are animated by positive energy and are powerful beings of neutral good alignment. 
**Areas of Concern** Glory, battle, bravery, honour
**Alignment** N
**Divine Font** Heal or Harm
**Divine Ability** Strength or Constitution
**Divine Skill** Athletics
**Domains** Confidence, Destruction, Might, Protection, Zeal

**Favoured Weapon** Double Scimitar

## The Undying Court ((++The Undying Court))
The elves of Aerenal revere their ancient dead as incarnate deities, seeking advice from deathless councillors and petitioning their favour. Unlike undead creatures, the deathless elves of the Undying Court are animated by positive energy and are powerful beings of neutral good alignment.

**Edicts** work toward collective transcendence, challenge oppression through education, protect knowledge, seek truth
**Anathema** destroy knowledge, disrespect the traditions of those around you, willfully spread ignorance or wrong information
**Favoured Weapon** Scimitar
|
## Cults of the Dragon Below
The Cults of the Dragon Below consist of a diverse group of fanatical sects that revere the power of the subterranean realms. Some of these cults seek to draw Khyber, the Dragon Below, up from the depths of the world, while others traffic with demons conjured from the deep regions. The City of the Dead in Aerenal seek a promised paradise in some lost cavern far below the surface, purifying themselves with a blood sacrifice to make themselves worthy to find it. Though little unites these mad cults beyond their reverence for the forbidden powers of Khyber, they are generally neutral evil.
