# The World of Eberron ((The World of Eberron))
The world of Eberron is an interconnected network of Nations, Territories, and Ancient Empires. Ancient grudges and fresh wounds simmer in the embers of the last war. Tensions are high, and the need for heroes is desperate.

right (
# National Lore
Most PCs will be natives of one of the nations of Khorvaire. This nationality will likely be an important part of their character, so consider giving each PC a trained lore skill for their nation.
# Regional Language
Languages in Eberron are typically based on location rather than ancestry. When picking languages, consider the languages local to your home region.
)
The world of Eberron is composed of five main continents: Aerenal, Argonessen, Frostfell, Khorvaire, Sarlona, and Xen'drik. Most PCs will start on the continent of Khorvaire, one of the major humanoid population centres of Eberron.

# Khorvaire ((+Khorvaire))
Khorvaire once stood as a united, proud human nation. However, in the wake of the last war it has splinted into the following separate nations and territories.

For more information on the Nations at a high level: see the **Eberronicon** (P. 20) or more in-depth in the **Eberron Campaign Setting** (p. 129).
