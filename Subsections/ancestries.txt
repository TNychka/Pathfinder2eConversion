# Core Ancestries ((++Core Ancestries))
Pathfinder 2e integrates a significant amount of Golarian lore into the mechanics and feats of core ancestries. While all of the mechanics are solid, the flavour associated with the ancestries and their feats occasionally diverge from the flavour or lore of Eberron. In the majority of cases, it is close enough to Eberron that it doesn't warrant a rewrite, however, you should consider modifying the flavour of your PC to fit the world of Eberron. As always, work with your GM if you are unsure.

This guide does not aim to provide information about

the Ancestries, but instead guidance about implementing their mechanics in the world.
