# Wandslinger (Class Archetype) ((+Wandslinger))
Wielding wands alongside weapons, wandslingers are masters of a new form of martial art - wandslinging. Wandslinging is the art of blending arcane spell duelling with martial combat efficiency, enabling wandslingers to perform feats of combat prowess that neither wizard nor fighter could. Though they cast spells, they do so through the use of widespread items - wands and staves - rather than by arcane incantation. The flexibility to perform in many roles, along with their tenacity, grit, and martial expertise, has begun to develop the wandslingers notable reputation throughout Khorvaire. 

## Way of the Wandslinger (1st)
You've learned the intricacies of magic and wands, blending the two with deadly results. You combine a working knowledge of arcane theories with a strong connection to improvised wands that allows you to manifest spells in battle alongside your martial combat. You must select Wandslinger Dedication from the Wandslinger archetype as your 2nd-level class feat.

  **Prerequisites:** Must be a gunslinger.
  **Wandslinger Adjustments:** Instead of choosing a way from the options listed in the gunslinger class, you have the way of the wandslinger. It has the following way skill, slinger's reload, and deeds. You gain these abilities at the same levels as normal for the class. You use Intelligence for your class DC. 
  **Way Skill** Arcana
  **Slinger's Reload** Arcane Blowback
 **Deeds** _Initial_ Quick Wand; _Advanced_ Spellfire; _Greater_ Fastest Wand in the West;

### Slinger's Reload
item(
# Arcane Blowback :f:
-
; Wandslinger, Magical
**Trigger** You use the Cast a Spell activity from an item such as a Wand or Stave.
-
As you discharge the arcane energy of an item, you syphon off the arcane charge that builds around you to reload your gun with a magical bolt or bullet. When you use the Cast a Spell activity to cast a spell (but not a cantrip), you create a magical charge of energy - conjuring an ordinary level-0 bolt or bullet out of thin air and then immediately Interacting to load it into your weapon. You don't need a free hand to reload in this way. If the bolt or bullet isn't fired before the end of your next turn, the effect is wasted.
)
### Initial Deeds
item(
# Quick Wand :a:
-
; Wandslinger
As part of your Arcane incantations, you stow a wand, or stave and draw another to cast from with a single fluid motion. If you are holding something in one hand, you may stow the object. You may then interact to draw a wand or stave.
)
### Advanced Deed 9th
item(
# Spellfire
-
; Wandslinger
**Requirements** You are wielding a wand or stave capable of casting a one, two, or three action spell that requires a spell attack roll.
-
As you unleash the power of your spell, you manipulate the composition of the arcane delivery mechanism to make the spell behave like a bullet. You Cast a Spell from a wand or stave that takes 1, 2, or 3 actions and requires a spell attack roll. Reduce the number of actions required by 1 (minimum 0). The effects of the spell don't occur immediately but are imbued into your wand or stave instead. Until the item is used, it is considered a loaded advanced firearm. When you make a ranged firearm strike using the item, you discharge the effects of the spell. If the effect is not used before the start of your next turn, the effect is lost.
)
=
note(
# Spellfire Specifics
Spellfire allows you to use wands as firearms, using spells as bullets. After spending the first actions to cast the spell, the effects occur when the Strike action is used to discharge the spell like a fired bullet.
For instance, you could use Spellfire to imbue your wand with Ray of Frost by spending 1 action, then make a regular strike or use an ability such as Blast Lock, Called Shot, Cauterize, Cover Fire, Paired Shots, Penetrating Fire, or Ricochet Shot where Ray of Frost replaces one of the strikes.

**Targeting:** The spell targets only one target of your Strike, even if it normally allows more targets. If your Strike targets more than one target such as with Bullet Split or Penetrating Fire, only one target takes the effects of the spell and the additional targets instead take the take force damage equal to your spellcasting modifier.

**Misfire:** If your wand would "misfire" as a result of the ability you used, you instead take force damage equal to your level.

**Ancillary Effects:** Your spell still has any non-targeted effects that might affect creatures other than the target, as well as any ongoing effects starting from the moment you hit with the Strike. For example, acid splash would still deal its splash damage to creatures other than the target and tanglefoot's circumstance penalty would last for its normal duration. The spell takes effect after the Strike deals damage; if the Strike has other special effects, the GM determines whether they happen before or after the spell.

**Multiple Defenses:** Any additional rolls after the initial spell attack still happen normally, such as the Fortitude save attempted by the target of a disintegrate spell. Similarly, a spell that allows you to attack with it again on subsequent rounds can only replace a Strike with its initial attack roll, not with any later ones.

**Variable Actions:** Some spells have different effects based on the number of actions you spend to cast them. You choose whether to use the effects of the 1-action, 2-action, or 3-action version of the spell when you use Spellfire. A spell has to take exactly 1, 2, or 3 actions; you can't use Spellfire with a spell that takes a free action, reaction, or 4 or more actions.

**Metamagic:** You typically can't use metamagic with Spellfire because metamagic requires the next action you take to be Cast a Spell, and Spellfire is a combined activity that doesn't qualify.

### Greater Deed 15th
item(
# Fastest Wand In the West :f:
-
; Wandslinger
**Trigger** You use Spellfire to replace a ranged firearm strike.

**Frequency** until recharged (see below)
-
You are the fastest wand in the west, east, south, and north. When you use Spellfire to replace a ranged firearm strike, you may interact to stow the wand, draw a loaded firearm, and make a regular strike as well. The spell follows the rules for Spellfire, while the strike follows the regular strike rules including multiple targets. This counts as an additional attack for your multiple attack penalty, but you don't apply the penalty until after you've completed  strike.

After you use Fastest Wand In the West, you can't do so again until you dissipate the arcane charge built up around you as a single action, which has the concentrate trait.

### Wandslinger Archetype Feats

# Wandslinger Dedication
## Feat 2
-
; Archetype, Class, Dedication
**Prerequisites** way of the wandslinger
-
You've armed yourself with a wand and a rudimentary knowledge of arcane theory to create temporarily functional wands. You gain the Cast a Spell activity, and can cast arcane spells. Each time you gain a spell slot of a new level from the wandslinger archetype, add a spell of that level or lower to your spellbook. However - unlike a normal spellcaster - you can only use the Cast a Spell activity by Activating an item. You gain a special spellbook with wand incantations for four common arcane cantrips of your choice. During your daily preparations, you create two unique cantrip wands each capable of casting one of these cantrips. These cantrip wands have no limit to their use and are never at risk of overcharge. 

Any wand or stave that you use is considered an advanced martial firearm, and loaded while it still has a least one charge or daily use remaining. The use of these wands or staves still requires the Cast a Spell activity rather than a Strike action, and may not be used as a replacement for Strikes as a result. You do not become trained in spell attack rolls or spell DCs from this source. Instead, when casting from any wand

spells is Intelligence, and they are arcane gunslinger spells.

During your daily preparations, you can prepare a staff as a prepared spellcaster. If you do not have the basic bounded spellcasting benefits yet, your highest-level spell slot is considered 1st level for the purposes of preparing a staff during your daily preparations.

You become trained in Arcana; if you were already trained in Arcana, you instead become trained in a skill of your choice.

These wands follow the normal rules of wands, including once per day use, but they may not be overcharged.
