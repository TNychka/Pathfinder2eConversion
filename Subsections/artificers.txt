Artifice tools are a special subset of artisan's tools with all the equipment required to manufacture magical items of any nature. If you have a set of these tools, you do not need different sets for different work, as may be required of regular Artisan's Tools. If you wear your artisan's tools, you can draw and replace them as part of the action that uses them.

# Infused: 
The core rule book infused trait only applies to alchemical items. However, the artificer produces non-alchemical items with the infused trait. The new trait should read as such
  
; Infused 
You created an item with the infused trait, and it has a limited time before it becomes inert. Any nonpermanent effects from your infused items from any source, with the exception of afflictions such as slow-acting poisons, end when you make your daily preparations again.
)
# Class Features
You gain these abilities as an artificer. Abilities gained at higher levels list the level at which you gain the, next to the features' names.

## Ancestry and Background
In addition to what you gain from you chosen class at 1st level, you have the benefits of your selected ancestry and background.

## Initial Proficiencies
At 1st level, you gain a number of proficiencies that represent your basic training. These proficiencies are noted at the start of this class.

## Artifice
You understand the fundamentals of arcana and tinker with its workings. While spellcasters specialize in the utilization of arcane forces, you construct and build the very essence of magic into magical constructions called infusions. These infusions allow you to rapidly prototype magical items to meet your needs. You can do this using the normal Crafting activity, or you can create special infused items that replicate a magical effect for a temporary duration quickly and at no cost. Over time, you can improvise more potent infusions more often. With your ability to improvise for any situation, you are the ultimate magical MacGyver.

You gain the Magical Crafting feat, even if you don't meet that feat's prerequisites, and you gain the four common magical formulas granted by that feat, but only items up to 1st-level. You can use this feat to create magic items as long as you have the items' formulas in your formula book.

### Magical Infusion
You prepare your artisian's tools to create infused items, allowing you to prototype temporary magical items at no cost. Each day during your daily preparations, you prepare to create a number of infusions equal to your level + your Intelligence modifier. You can create these infusions using either advanced artifice or quick artifice, described below. 

As soon as you make your next daily preparations, your infusions from the previous day's preparations lose the magical effects of your modifications, and nonpermanent effects of your previous day's infused items immediately end. While infusions create magical properties on physical objects, they can't be duplicated, preserved, or created in any way other than your daily preparations.

### Advanced Artifice
During your daily preparations, after preparing your tools, you can create infused items. You don't need to attempt a Crafting check to do this, and you ignore the number of days typically required to create the items. Your advanced artifice level is noted in the artificer infusion table. For each infusion you create, choose a magical item of your advanced artifice level or lower that's in your formula book, and create that item. These items have the infused trait and remain potent for 24 hours or until your next daily preparations, whichever comes first.

item(
# Quick Infusion :aa:
; Artificer, Manipulate
-
**Cost** 1 infusion

**Requirements** You have the formula for the magical item you're creating, and you're either holding or wearing Artisan's tools.
-
You swiftly prototype a magical item to use at a moment's notice. You create a single magical item of your advanced artifice level or lower that's in your formula book without having to spend the normal monetary cost in components or needing to attempt a Crafting check. This item has the infused trait, but it remains potent only for the next 10 minutes.
)

## Formula Book
An artificer keeps meticulous records of the formulas for every item they can create. You start with a standard formula book worth 10 sp or less for free. The formula book contains the formulas for two common 1st-level magic items of your choice, in addition to those you gained from Magical Crafting and your artifice style.

Each time you gain a level, you can add the formulas for two common magic items to your formula book. These new formulas can be for any level of item you can create. You learn these formulas automatically, but it's also possible to find or buy additional formulas in settlements or from other artificers, or to invent them with the Inventor feat.

## Sample Formula Book
You can choose any 1st-level common magic items for your formula book, but the list below contains a good selection of starter formulas.

Artificer Item Formulas: TODO

## Artifice Profession
Your developments in artifice have lead you to specialize in a particular profession of artifice. You might have a degree from an arcane institute, correspond with other artificers in your field, or work as a genius loner. Choose an artificer profession.

Your profession adds a number of formulas to your formula book; these are your signature items. Once during your daily preparations, you can create an infused signature item using advanced artifice without expending one of your infusions. Each time you gain a level, you can swap one of your signature items with another formula in your formula book. This new signature item must be on your artifice professions' list of possible signature items.
