# Artificer ((+Artificer))
In Eberron, magic is the driving force behind the technology of the world. Much like an engineer is to a pure mathematician - artificers tinker with the fundamental structures and applications, while spellcasters specialize in the high-level abstract structures of advanced magic. Artificers have a similar yet very different understanding of magic that simply isn't necessary for a spellcaster, and as a result, they cannot cast spells as a wizard can. Yet, an artificer can use the fundamental arcane forces of magic to create new arcane effects that a spellcaster could never hope to achieve. By applying the theory of magic to everyday life, artificers are the innovators and inventors of the future of Khorvaire.

## During Combat Encounters...
With clever insight and understanding of the magical tools, you use your skill as an artificer to create the perfect item to give you and your allies an edge in combat. These items might increase the damage of your ally's weapons, coat the ground in a slippery oil causing the enemies to fall, reinforce your armour to ensure you only take glancing blows or even assist your team in overcoming obstacles in your way.

## During Social Encounters...
During social encounters, you can provide insight into academic topics, particularly those related to magical items and crafting. You might often try to pick up on potential new applications of your artifice or learn about new developments and advancements of artifice in your technique.

## While Exploring...
While exploring the world you may search for deposits of rare minerals and dragonshards to use in your creations, and keep an eye out for hidden arcane secrets related to making magic items or constructs. All the while, you create and improvise solutions to overcome hazards and obstacles in your journeys.

## In Downtime...
You gather collected components and tinker with the fundamentals of arcana to create new and advanced designs for magical technology. This may be in the manufacture of new items, or the development of fundamental arcane magics.

## You Might...
- Thrive when you refine your applications of magic or assemble bits of arcane theory never tested before.
- Take a chance on the construction of your arcane fundamentals to improvise a rapid solution to a problem.
=
- Have a variety of gizmos, arcane bits, tools, and dragonshards hidden in various pockets and pouches across your person - and venture off on excited and technical tangents when asked simple questions.

## Others Probably...
- Are in awe of the variety of magical applications you can improvise a solution to at a moment's notice.
- Believe you would be better off working as an extraordinarily talented magewright rather than an adventurer.
- Others who see your arcane fundamentals functionally assembled may fear that it's held together by nothing but spit, grit, and prayers to Onatar. They may be right. 

# Class Features
You gain these abilities as an artificer. Abilities gained at higher levels list the levels at which you gain them next to the features' names.

## Ancestry and Background
In addition to what you gain from your chosen class at 1st level, you have the benefits of your selected ancestry and background.

## Artifice
You understand the fundamentals of arcana and tinker with its workings. While spellcasters specialize in the utilization of arcane forces, you can assemble that same magic at a fundamental level to rapidly create temporary items to meet your needs. These temporary items allow you to replicate difficult to create permanent magical items on the fly. You can create permanent magic items using the normal Crafting activity, or you can use arcane fundamentals to rapidly create artifice items that last for a short duration at no cost. Over time, you can improvise stronger artifice items more often. With your ability to create a magical solution for any situation, you are the ultimate magical improviser.

You gain the Crafter's Appraisal and Magical Crafting feats, even if you don't meet the feats' prerequisites. You gain the four magical formulas granted by Magical Crafting, which may include 2nd level items.

=
### Arcane fundamentals
You prepare your artificer's tools and set of arcane components, dragonshards, gizmos, and gadgets - collectively called arcane fundamentals - for the day. These arcane fundamentals are the key component to your artifice that allow you to prototype temporary magical items called artifice items quickly and at no cost.  Each day during your daily preparations, you prepare up to two 2nd-level arcane fundamentals. You may only use these arcane fundamentals for Quick Artifice, described below. All of your arcane fundamentals are considered to be part of the bulk of your artificer's tools.

As soon as you make your next daily preparations, your arcane fundamentals from the previous day lose their power and expire. All the nonpermanent effects of your previous day's arcane fundamentals' artifice items immediately end. While arcane fundamentals are magical physical objects, they can't be duplicated, preserved, or created in any way other than during your daily preparations. Any arcane fundamentals that you did not prepare yourself are an enigma to you, and may not be used by you for any purpose.

As you increase in level as an artificer, the number and strength of arcane fundamentals you can prepare increases - as shown in Table 6-2: Arcane Fundamentals per Day. Your advanced artificer level is the same as your level as an artificer.

### Quick Artifice
If you need a specific artifice item on the fly, you can use your arcane fundamentals to quickly create it with the Quick Artifice action.
|
item(
# Quick Artifice :a:
; Artificer, Manipulate
-
**Cost** 1 arcane fundamental of the artifice item level or higher

**Requirements** You have the formula for the artifice item that you're creating, and the item is your advanced artifice level or lower. You're either holding your Artificer's tools, or wearing them and have a free hand. 

**Targets, Range, Duration** Detailed artifice item's category noted below.
-
You swiftly prototype an artifice item to replicate a more permanent magic item at a moment's notice. You select a magical artifice item that's in your formula book of your advanced artifice level or lower, and create that item using an arcane fundamental of the item's level or higher without having to spend the normal monetary cost in components or needing to attempt a Crafting check. This item has the magical and temporary trait, but it remains potent only for the next 10 minutes.
)

## Artifice Items
Artifice items are magical temporary prototype versions of permanent items composed of arcane fundamentals. Due to their haphazard construction, all artifice items radiate magical auras and rapidly destabilize, but otherwise behave the same as any normal item. Their effects last for a set amount of time or until they are countered in some way, typically magically.

You may create any common Adventuring gear, Magic Held Items, Magic Worn Items, or Runes as artifice items. As you increase in level as an artificer, the repertoire of types of items you can create along with the number and level of these items increases. You may use items with other rarities as artifice items with GM permission. Some artifice items have additional requirements beyond those stated in the Craft activity; these apply to the Quick Artifice action and must be satisfied as part of the requirements. If there are additional requirements for artifice items, they are noted below. You may only create items as artifice items if you have access to them as part of your artifice item repetoire - this does not restrict your regular crafting. 

All artifice items have the artifice, magical, and temporary traits, in addition to their regular traits. If an item has the invested trait, it loses it. Since artifice items are simply a copy of a permanent magical item, their unstable and temporary nature means they have no market price.
=
### Artifice Item Categories
Artifice items generally fall into an overall category which dictates how they are created and behave.

item(
# Equipment Artifice Items
-
; Artifice, Magical, Temporary
**Targets** 1 willing creature or empty adjacent square

**Range** Touch; **Duration** 1 hour
-
Equipment artifice items are made manifest by the magic of your arcane fundamentals. If you target a willing creature, you may manifest the item directly to its appropriate usage (such as held, or worn) or into their inventory to be retrieved with an interact action. For example you may manifest plate armour directly on an unarmoured willing creature, a longsword directly into a creature's free hand, or a dagger into their backpack. You could not however, manifest plate armour onto a creature wearing a different set of armour, or a longsword into the hands of a creature who's hands are full, or a dagger into the inventory of a creature without means to carry an object. Alternatively, you may manifest the object directly in a free adjacent square.
)
item(
# Consumable Artifice Items
-
; Artifice, Magical, Temporary
**Targets** 1 willing creature, or empty adjacent square

**Range** Touch; **Duration** 10 minutes
-
Consumable artifice items are made manifest by the magic of your arcane fundamentals. If you target a willing creature, you may manifest the item directly into their possession to be retrieved by them. This may either be in their backpack, held by them, worn by them if they have an appropriate holder such as a bandolier for potions or quiver for arrows. Alternatively, you may manifest the object directly in a free adjacent square.
)
item(
# Magical Implement Artifice Items
-
; Artifice, Magical, Temporary
**Targets** 1 willing creature or empty adjacent square

**Range** Touch; **Duration** 10 minutes
-
You create and infuse a mundane implement you carry with you to sustain the magic of your artifice.  If you target a willing creature, you may manifest the item directly to its appropriate usage (such as held) or into their inventory to be retrieved with an interact action.
)
item(
# Applied Artifice Items
-
; Artifice, Magical, Temporary
**Targets** 1 willing creature, or object in possession of a willing creature;

**Range** Touch; **Duration** 10 minutes
-
When you create an applied artifice item, if you are touching the object in possession of a willing creature or willing creature to be affixed you may affix it as part of the Quick Artifice action. Otherwise, you may create the object in temporary stasis in a free hand and then apply the artifice item as a 1 action activity.

Applying an applied artifice item to an object does not supress any existing objects - such as affixed talismans or tattoos. You may only have one applied artifice item per object and creature at a time.
)
|
item(
# Worn Artifice Items
-
; Artifice, Magical, Temporary
**Targets** worn item of the appropriate type either unposessed or in possession of a willing creature;

**Range** Touch; **Duration** 10 minutes
-
When you create a worn artifice item, you must be touching the mundane or magical worn item of the same usage (GM's discretion) that does not already have the artifice trait. If the item is in the possession of a different creature, it must be willing to allow the item to be a target. 

The targeted item takes on the magical properties and traits of the artifice item in addition to any properties it currently has.
)
item(
# Held Artifice Items
-
; Artifice, Magical, Temporary
**Targets** held item of the appropriate type either unposessed or in possession of a willing creature;

**Range** Touch; **Duration** 10 minutes
-
When you create a held artifice item, you must be touching the mundane or magical held item of the same appropriate type (GM's discretion) that does not already have the artifice trait. If the item is in possession of a different creature, it must be willing to allow the item to be a target.

The targeted item takes on the magical properties and traits of the artifice item in addition to any properties it currently has.
)
item(
# Rune Artifice Items
-
; Artifice, Magical, Temporary
**Targets** item of the appropriate type either unposessed or in possession of a willing creature;

**Range** Touch; **Duration** 10 minutes
-
When you create a rune artifice item, if you are touching the object to be etched you may etch it as part of the Quick Artifice action. Otherwise, you may create the rune on a temporary runestone in a free hand and complete the Transfer a Rune activity as a 1 action activity. You may use your artificer tools rather than a repair kit for Transfering the Rune.

Artifice Item runes do not count towards the number of property runes on an item, and thus may exceed the standard number allowed by the potency rune or be applied to an item without a potency rune. Fundamental runes still may not stack, and thus you cannot add a fundamental rune of the same type to an item that already has one - artifice item or not.
)
=
## Formula Book
An artificer keeps meticulous records of the formulas for every item they can create. You start with a standard formula book containing worth 10 sp or less for free. The formula book contains the formulas for common adventuring gear, armor, shields, and weapons. It also contains four common 1st-level artifice items of your choice, in addition to the artifice item formulas you gained from the Magical Crafting skill feat.

Each time you gain a level, you can add the formulas for two common artifice items to your formula book. These new formulas can be for any level up to your advanced artifice level. You learn these formulas automatically, but it's also possible to find or buy additional formulas in settlements or from other artificers, or to invent them with the Inventor feat. 

### Sample Formula Book
You can choose any 1st-level common artifice items or items from your technique for your formula book, but the list below contains a good selection of starter formulas.

**Item Formulas:** Charlatan's Gloves (PFGtE), Cloak of Feline Rest, Everburning Torch, Plane Stone of Absorbsion (PFGtE), Plane Stone of Discharge (PFGtE), Featherfall Token (PFGtE), Ring of Discretion, Battle Rod (PFGtE)

## Artifice Technique
Your developments in artifice have led you to specialize in a particular aspect of artifice. You might have a degree from an arcane institute, correspond with other artificers in your field, or work as a genius loner. Choose an artificer technique.
|
### Traditional
As a traditional artificer, you follow the established field and theories of Artifice. With long-standing techniques developed and refined by Cannith and the Arcane Congress, your work explores and expands upon the great work of those before you. 

At first level, pick two artifice items from your formula book to make your signature artifice items. Twice per day, you can choose to ignore the arcane fundamental cost to use Quick Artifice to create a signature artifice item of your advanced artifice level or lower. 

Each time you gain a level you may learn one additional formula for a common artifice item. In addition, you can swap one of your signature artifice items with another artifice item formula in your formula book.

**Expert Traditional Artificer 5th**
Three times per day, you can create a signature artifice item of your artifice level or lower without expending an arcane fundamental. In addition, select one additional artifice item to add to your signature artifice item list.

**Master Traditional Artificer 11th**
You have learned how to assemble your arcane fundamentals in a way that allows near infinite supply of your signature items. Once 10 per minutes, you may create one of your signature items of 2nd level or lower using Quick Artifice without expending an arcane fundamental. In addition, select one additional artifice item to add to your signature artifice item list.

**Legendary Traditional Artificer 17th**
You have become a legend of Artifice, and specialized your technique in the manufacture of specific types of items. You may pick one category of artifice item that you have access to. This category becomes your signature artifice list, and you may treat any artifice item from the list as a signature item. You may reselect all of your current signature items when you gain this feature. With downtime and retraining, you may spend a week to reselect this category of item, specializing in a new artifice item category that you have access to.
=
### Homonculus Crafter
Your artifice is structured around the creating small magical creatures powered by magic called homunculi. By specializing in this technique, you have created a specialized and unique homunculus familiar. You gain the Homunculus artificer feat - granting you a homunculus familiar, a Tiny construct of some ingenious artifice design. Since your homonculous familiar is so advanced, your familiar gains an extra ability. See the additional artificer familiar and master abilities in this document. In addition, you may change one of your familiar's abilities with a 10 minute activity by tweaking and changing the form of your familiar using your artificer's tools. You can reselect only familiar abilities you would normally be able to reselect each day, not required familiar abilities for your familiar. You can't remove an ability that is required for another ability your familiar has (for instance, you can't remove manual dexterity if the familiar has lab assistant). When you do so, you may change any one of their abilities with any other ability they would normally have access to.

**Expert Homonculus Artificer - 5th**
Your familiar gains an extra ability. In addition, you have the ability to draw power from your familiar and use them as a substitute for an arcane fundamental of your advanced artifice level or lower for Quick Artifice. When the artifice item expires, your familiar is also drained and becomes inert. During your next daily preparations, your familiar recharges itself to full functionality. If your familiar is ever destroyed, you may expend an arcane fundamental of your advanced artifice level during your daily preparations to restore your familiar to life.

**Master Homonculus Artificer 11th**
Your familiar gains an extra ability. You have improved your ability to reconstruct your familiar, and you may expend an arcane fundamental of one less than your advanced artifice level or higher to rebuild or recharge your familiar with a 10-minute activity.

**Legendary Homonculus Artificer 17th**
Your familiar gains an extra ability, and you have become so proficient at fixing and recreating your homoculus familars that when you rebuild your familiar you may do so without using any arcane fundamentals.

### Arcanist
As an arcanist artificer, you apply the pure magical theory of spellcasting to your crafts - combining high-level theory with fundamentals to powerful results. By utilising the arcane stabilization matrix inherent to items and analyzing the weave of magic spells, you have the ability to manufacture items that cast spells - bypassing the need to cast spell yourself. You may craft Scrolls as artifice items, which are of the Magical Implements category. Additionally, you gain the Trick Magic Item feat. When using Trick Magic Item on artifice items, you gain a +2 circumstance bonus to your check.
|
When you gain formulas, you may also learn a special type of formula called a Spell Formula. Spell Formulas are unique way for you to write spells into your formula book. Though you do not have spellcasting to cast these spells, you can substitute a Spell Formula in place of casting a spell during the creation process of items that requires the spell. When you level up, you may select to learn a Spell Formula for a spell from the arcane list rather than selecting a formula for an artifice item. A Spell Forumla's level is equal to an equivalent scroll of the same spell (which is twice the spell level minus one). You can use the Learn a Spell activity for arcane spells, though it takes you twice as long. If you successfully learn a spell, you may add it to your formula book as a Spell Formula.

**Expert Arcanist Artificer 5th**
You are a master in the utilisation of spell casting artifice items and your creations never fail you. You automatically succeed on Trick Magic Item when using artifice items.

**Master Arcanist Artificer 11th**
You have reduced the activation energy of your spell-casting items, and you may use Trick Magic Item as a free action. In addition you may select one of the occult, primal, or divine traditions and learn spell formulas for spells of the associated spell list. The spells formulas must be no more than half your advanced artifice level.

**Legendary Arcanist Artificer 17th**
You have become legendary in your craft, and you can recreate the effect of spells from any tradition of magic. You may learn spell formulas for spells any of occult, primal, or divine spell lists. The spells formulas must be no more than half your advanced artifice level.

## Initial Proficiencies
At 1st level, you gain a number of proficiencies that represent your basic training. These proficiencies are noted at the start of this class.

## Powerful Artifice
The artifice items you create are particularly potent. When you create an artifice item that allows a saving throw, you can change its DC to your class DC.
=
## Artificer Feats
At 1st level and every even-numbered level, you gain an artificer class feat. Most features and feats require you to have your artificer tools and arcane fundamentals available. If you are deprived of your gear for some reason, you might lose access to many feats and features, subject to GM discretion.

## Skill Feats 2nd
At 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a skill feat. You must be trained or better in the corresponding skill to select a skill feat.

## Sustained Artifice 2nd
At 2nd level, you have the ability to maintain your artifice items beyond their normal duration. You may sustain your artifice items using the Sustain an Activation action, maintaining them beyond their normal expiration. You only need to begin Sustaining Artifice items once they go beyond their maximum duration. If you cease to sustain an artifice item, the item expires as normal. 

## General Feats 3rd
At 3rd level and every 4 levels thereafter, you gain a general feat.

## Skill Increases 3rd
At 3rd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a skill increase. You can use this increase to either become trained in one skill you're untrained in or become an expert in one skill in which you're already trained.

At 7th level, you can use skill increases to become a master in a skill in which you're already an expert, and at 15th level, you can use them to become legendary in a skill in which you're already a master.

## Skilled Expert 3rd
You've increased your skill in Artifice. You become an expert in Crafting.

## Ability Boosts 5th
At 5th level and every 5 levels thereafter, you boost four different ability scores. You can use these ability boosts to increase your ability scores above 18. Boosting an ability score increases it by 1 if it's already 18 or above, or by 2 if it starts out below 18.

## Ancestry Feats 5th
In addition to the ancestry feat you started with, you gain an ancestry feat at 5th level and every 4 levels thereafter.

# Feats
note(
# Magewright Spells
Certain feats grant you magewright spells, which are a type of focus spells. It costs 1 Focus Point to cast a focus spell. When you gain your first magewright spell, you also gain a focus pool of 1 focus point. You refill your focus pool during your daily preparations, and you regain 1 focus point by spending 10 minutes using the Refocus activity to reorganize your tools and study your formulas.

Your magewright spells are spells of the arcane tradition. You become trained in arcane spell attacks and spell DCs and your key spellcasting ability is Intelligence.

Focus spells are automatically heightened to half your level rounded up. Taking feats can give you more focus spells and increase the size of your focus pool, though your focus pool can never hold more than 3 focus points. The full rules for focus spells appear [here](https://2e.aonprd.com/Rules.aspx?ID=276).

; Artificer
The best artificers are master of their craft, and their tools. You gain access to a special belt you have designed specifically for your craft, which may be worn as a belt, bandolier, or satchel. This belt holds your Artificer's Tools, and one other set of tools you own that weigh 1 Bulk or less. You may use Quick Artifice without having a hand free, and you do not need to have a free hand to use other set of tools contained in this belt. These two tools do not count against the usual limit of tools you can wear. If you're carrying or stowing the belt rather than wearing it as a belt or bandolier, its Bulk is light instead of negligible and these benefits do not apply.
