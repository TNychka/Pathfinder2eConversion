# Artificer ((+Artificer))
In Eberron, magic is the driving force behind the technology of the world. Much like an engineer is to a pure mathematician - artificers tinker with the fundamental structures and applications, while spellcasters specialize in the high level abstract structures of advanced magic. Artificers have a similar yet very different understanding of magic that simply isn't necessary for a spellcaster, and as a result they cannot cast spells like a wizard can. Yet, an artificer can use the fundamental arcane forces of magic to create new arcane effects that a spellcaster could never hope to achieve. By applying the theory of magic to the every day, artificers are the innovators and inventors of the future of Khorvaire.

## During Combat Encounters...
With clever insight and understanding of the magical tools, you use your skill as an artificer to create the perfect item to give you and your allies an edge in the combat. These items might increase the damage of your ally's weapons, coat the ground in a slippery oil causing the enemies to fall, reinforce your armor to ensure you only take glancing blows, or even assist your team in overcoming obstacles in your way.

## During Social Encounters...
During social encounters you can provide insight into academic topics, particularly those related to magical items and crafting. You might often try to pick up on potential new applications of your artifice, or learn about new developments and advancements of artifice in your technique.

## While Exploring...
While exploring the world you may search for deposits of rare minerals and dragonshards to use in your creations, and keep an eye out for hidden arcane secrets related to making magic items or constructs. All the while, you create and improvise solutions to overcome hazards and obstacles in your journeys.

## In Downtime...
You gather collected components and tinker with the fundamentals of arcana to create new and advanced designs for magical technology. This may be in the manufacture of new items, or in the development of fundamental arcane magics.

## You Might...
- Thrive when you refine your applications of magic or assemble bits of arcane theory never tested before.
- Take a chance on the construction of your arcane fundamentals to improvise a rapid solution to a problem.
=
- Have a variety of gizmos, arcane bits, tools, and dragonshards hidden in various pockets and pouches across your person - and venture off on excited and technical tangents when asked simple questions.

## Others Probably...
- Be in awe of the variety of magical applications you can improvise a solution to at a moment's notice.
- Believe that you are a spellcaster simply using a unique form of spell.
- Others who see your arcane fundamentals functionally assembled may fear that it's held together by nothing but spit, grit, and prayers to Onatar. They may be right. 

note(
# Infused:
The core rule book infused trait only applies to alchemical items. However, the artificer produces non-alchemical items with the infused trait. The new trait should read as such
  
; Infused 
You created an item with the infused trait, and it has a limited time before it becomes inert. Any nonpermanent effects from your infused items from any source, with the exception of afflictions such as slow-acting poisons, end when you make your daily preparations again.

# Class Features
You gain these abilities as an artificer. Abilities gained at higher levels list the level at which you gain the, next to the features' names.

## Ancestry and Background
In addition to what you gain from you chosen class at 1st level, you have the benefits of your selected ancestry and background.

## Initial Proficiencies
At 1st level, you gain a number of proficiencies that represent your basic training. These proficiencies are noted at the start of this class.

## Artifice
You understand the fundamentals of arcana and tinker with its workings. While spellcasters specialize in the utilization of arcane forces, you can assemble that same magic at a fundamental level to rapidly create artifice items to meet your needs. These artifice items allow you to replicate difficult to create permanent magical items on the fly. You can create permanent magic items using the normal Crafting activity, or you can use arcane fundamentals to rapidly create artifice items that last for a short duration at no cost. Over time, you can improvise stronger artifice items more often. With your ability to create a magical solution for any situation, you are the ultimate magical improvisor.

You gain the Crafter's Appraisal and Magical Crafting feats, even if you don't meet the feats' prerequisites. You gain the four magical formulas granted by Magical Crafting, but you may only choose 1st level artifice items. 

### Arcane fundamentals
You prepare your artificer's tools and set of arcane components, gizmos, and gadgets - collectively called arcane fundamentals - for the day. These arcane fundamentals are the key component to your artifice that allow you to prototype temporary magical items called artifice items quickly and at no cost. Your advanced artifice level is equal to your level. Each day during your daily preparations, you gain up to two 2nd-level arcane fundamentals. You can use these arcane fundamentals for Quick Artifice, described below. All of the components of your of your arcane fundamentals are considered part of the bulk of your artificer's tools.
|
As soon as you make your next daily preparations, your arcane fundamentals from the previous day lose their power and expire. All the nonpermanent effects of your previous day's arcane fundamentals' artifice items immediately end. While arcane fundamentals are magical physical objects, they can't be duplicated, preserved, or created in any way other than during your daily preparations. Any arcane fundamentals that you did not prepare yourself are an enigma to you, and may not be used by you for any purpose.

As you increase in level as an artificer, your number of arcane fundamentals and the highest level of arcane fundamental you can prepare increase, shown in Table 6-2: Arcane Fundamentals per Day.

### Quick Artifice
If you need a specific artifice item on the fly, you can use your arcane fundamentals to quickly create it with the Quick Artifice action.

item(
# Quick Artifice :a:
; Artificer, Manipulate
-
**Cost** 1 arcane fundamental of the artifice item level or higher

**Requirements** You have the formula for the artifice item that you're creating, and you're either holding or wearing Artificer's tools.

**Targets** Item to be imbued with the enhancement
-
You swiftly prototype an artifice item to replicate a more permanent magic item at a moment's notice. You select a magical artifice item that's in your formula book of your advanced artifice level or lower, and create that item using an arcane fundamental of the item's level or higher without having to spend the normal monetary cost in components or needing to attempt a Crafting check. This item has the infused trait, but it remains potent only for the next 10 minutes.

As part of this same action you can interact with an item on an willing adjacent creature to make the item the target of your Quick Artifice.
)
=
## Formula Book
An artificer keeps meticulous records of the formulas for every item they can create. You start with a standard formula book worth 10 sp or less for free. The formula book contains the formulas for four common 1st-level artifice items of your choice, in addition to the artifce item formulas you gained from the Magical Crafting skill feat. Artifice items are provided in this document.

Each time you gain a level, you can add the formulas for two common artifice items to your formula book. These new formulas can be for any level up to your advanced artifice level. You learn these formulas automatically, but it's also possible to find or buy additional formulas in settlements or from other artificers, or to invent them with the Inventor feat. 

In addition if you gain a forumla for a permanent item with an artifice item equivalent, you also gain the artifice item formula. If you gain an artifice item formula with a permanent item equivalent, you also gain the equivalent permanent item forumla.

### Sample Formula Book
You can choose any 1st-level common artifice items or items from your technique for your formula book, but the list below contains a good selection of starter formulas.

Item Formulas: TODO

## Artifice Technique
Your developments in artifice have lead you to specialize in a particular aspect of artifice. You might have a degree from an arcane institute, correspond with other artificers in your field, or work as a genius loner. Choose an artificer technique.


### Traditional
As a traditional artificer, you follow the established field and theories of Artifice. With long standing techqniues developed and refined by Cannith and the Arcane Congress, your work explores and expands upon the great work of those before you.

At first level, pick an artifice item from your formula book to make your signature artifice item. Once per day, you can choose to ignore the arcane fundamental cost to create a signature artifice item of your advanced artifice level or lower. Each time you gain a level, you can swap one of your signature artifice items with another artifice item formula in your formula book.
|
**Expert Traditional Artificer 5th**
Once per day, you can create two of your signature artifice items of your artifice level without expending an arcane fundamental.

**Master Traditional Artificer 11th**
Once per day, you can create three of your signature artifice items of your artifice level without expending an arcane fundamental.

**Legendary Traditional Artificer 17th**
Once per day, you can create four of your signature artifice items of your artifice level without expending an arcane fundamental.

### Constructed
Your artifice is structured around the utilization of small machinery powered by magic - including constructs. You have created a specialized homunculus familiar. You gain the Homunculus artificer feat - granting you a homunculus familiar, a Tiny construct of some ingenius artifice design. Other than taking the form of a construct instead of an animal and gaining the construct trait, this familiar uses all the same rules as other familiars. Your familiar gains an extra ability, Your familiar is an extension of your artifice, and can assist you with the creation of artifice items. See the additional artificer familiar and master abilities in this document.

**Expert Traditional Artificer 5th**
Familiar gains an extra ability. In addition if your familiar is destroyed, you may expend an arcane fundamental of your advanced artifice level during your next daily preparations to rebuild your familiar.

**Master Traditional Artificer 11th**
Familiar gains an extra ability. If your familiar is destroyed, you may expend an arcane fundamental of your advanced artifice level to rebuild your familiar with a 10 minute activity with the concentration trait.

**Legendary Traditional Artificer 17th**
Familiar gains an extra ability. In addition, you may construct and control a second familiar. Your two familiars share between the total number of abilities you can allocate, but you may split the abilities allocated to each however you wish. 

=

### Arcanist
As an arcanist artificer, you apply the pure magical theory of spellcasting to your crafts - combining high level theory with fundamentals to powerful results. By utilising the arcane stabilitzation matrix inherent to items, you may may also choose to create wands with your Quick Artifice. Wands with the infusion trait may not be overcharged, and are destroyed immediately after use. In addition, by understanding the magic behind these types of items you gain access to the Arcane Analysis as a skill feat.

When you gain formulas, you may also select to learn wand formula. These are special artifice forumlas that do not require you to supply the casting of a spell as a crafting requirement. However, rather than selecting the arcane spell when creating the wand - you must select the arcane spell when your create the formula. This formula may then only be used to create wands of the given level and spell. For example, your formula book may have the formulas for a Magic Wand (1st-Level Magic Missile) and Magic Wand (1st-Level Mage Armour). Finally, you may also use the Learn a Spell activity to create formulas for wands of the learned spell and level.

You start with the formulas for two 1st-level wands in your formula book, in addition to your other formulas.

**Expert Traditional Artificer 5th**
You have reduced the activation energy of your spell casting items. You may use Trick Magic Item as a free action.

**Master Traditional Artificer 11th**
You are a master in the utilisation of spell casting items. When using your Arcane Analysis, you automatically succeed on Trick Magic Item if the item's magic tradition is arcane.

**Legendary Traditional Artificer 17th**
You have become legendary as an Arcanist Artificer. With special practice, you create a wand capable of recharging its arcana with a meer 10 minutes of focus. You can spend 10 minutes to create one wand from your formula book of 9th level or lower without expending an arcane fundamental. You may only have one of these wands at a time. Once you create or recharge a wand using these 10 minutes of focus, all effects and durations of the previous wand end.

## Powerful Artifice
The artifice items you create are particularly potent. You have access to a special artifice item attack proficiency. Your artifice item attack is the same as any other attack roll, however you may use your intelligence modifier instead of strength or dexterity. When you create an artifce item that allows a saving throw, you can change its DC to your class DC. If the artifice item allows an attack roll (including mundane strikes), you can change its attack roll to your artifice item attack roll. Once the selection has been made, you may not change it. Any creature using the item uses these values.

|

## Artificer Feats
At 1st level and every even-numbered level, you gain an artificer class feat. Most features and feats require you to have your artificer tools and arcane fundamentals available. If you are deprived of your gear for some reason, you might lose access to many feats and features, subject to GM discretion.

# Feats [ IN PROGRESS  ]
note(
# Magewright Spells
Certain feats grant you magewright spells, which are a type of focus spells. It costs 1 Focus Point (FP) to cast a focus spell. When you gain your first magewright spell, you also gain a focus pool of 1 FP. You refill your focus pool during your daily preparations, and you regain 1 FP by spending 10 minutes using the Refocus activity to reorganize your tools.

Your magewright spells are arcane spells.

Focus spells are automatically heightened to half your level rounded up. Taking feats can give you more focus spells and increase the size of your focus pool, though your focus pool can never hold more than 3 FP. The full rules for focus spells appear [here](https://2e.aonprd.com/Rules.aspx?ID=276).

# Homunculous Abilities
**Artificing Assistant:** If your familiar is in your space, you can have it deliver your artifice with range touch at a range. You may use the Quick Artifice action, transfer the artifice item or infusion to your familiar, and command the familiar to deliver it. You familiar must have the manual dexterity ability to select this. If you do, the familiar uses its 2 actions for the round to move to a target of your choice and touch that target. If it doesn’t reach the target to touch it this turn, the infusion has no effect.

**Integrated Toolset:** If your familar is in your space, you are considered to be holding or wearing your artifice tool set. Since you supply your familiar with the tools, you can choose which set of artificer tools you own that your familiar is equivalent to.

# Master Abilities
**Fundamental Components:** Like the items you make, your familiar is simply a composition of arcane elements. You can convert your familiar into a set of arcane fundamentals of your level with an interact action. You may convert these arcane fundamentals back into your familiar with three interact actions.

### Alchemical Discipline
You have specialized in magical recreation of alchemical and potion effects. In addition to artifice items, you may also create alchemical and potion items with your Quick Artifice or advanced artifice. When you use an arcane fundamental to create a consumable, you or a willing creature within 5 feet of you may consume the item as part of the item creation.

You start with the formulas for two 1st-level potions or alchemical items in your formula book, in addition to your other formulas. Your signature infusions are alchemical items and potions.

### Advanced Artifice
During your daily preparations, after preparing your arcane fundamentals, you can spend arcane fundamentals to create artifice items. You don't need to attempt a Crafting check to do this, and you ignore the number of days typically required to create the items, but you must still have the materials for any Craft Requirements of the item. Your advanced artifice level is equal to your level. For each artifice item you create in this way, choose an artifice item of your advanced artifice level or lower that's in your formula book, and expend one arcane fundamental of that level or higher to create that item. These items have the infused trait and remain potent for 24 hours or until your next daily preparations, whichever comes first. If an artifice item you created expires in this way, you may recover all the material used by the Craft Requirements.


### Runes
You specialize in creation and etching of runes. You may create items in the Rune category with your Quick Artifice by touching an item that could accept the rune - even if this would exceed the maximum allowed by a potency rune or conflict with an existing fundamental rune. If you apply your arcane fundamentals to an item that has such a conflict, the user of the item may spend an action to interact and select which rune effects are active - creating a valid set of rune effects - but all other runes including fundamental runes then become dormant. 

You do not start with additional formulas in addition to your other formulas. However, at each level that a fundamental weapon or armor rune becomes available, you gain the rune as a formula automatically.

### Arcanist
As an arcanist artificer, you apply the pure magical theory of spellcasting to your crafts - combining the best of both sides to create powerful results. By utilising the arcane stabilitzation matrix inherent to items, you may may also choose to create wands with your Quick Artifice. Wands with the infusion trait may not be overcharged, and are destroyed immediately after use. With your understanding, you may also use any item that requires the Cast a Spell as if you had the arcane list.

When you gain formulas, you may instead select a spell from the arcane list and create a formula for a wand capable of casting that specific spell. Additionally, you may use the Learn a Spell activity to create the formula for a wand of that spell. When crafting or infusing wands, you do not need to be able to supply a listed-level casting of the spell and may create a wand of any heightened level up to your advanced artificer level.

You start with the formulas for two 1st-level wands in your formula book, in addition to your other formulas.

# Powerful Artifice
 If an item would require you to use a spell attack roll or regular attack roll, you can add your Intelligence modifier to your attack roll instead of your Strength or Dexterity modifier.
 
 
## Peerless Artificer 7th
You are a ceaseless arcane tinkerer, and your ability to create magical effects is next to none. You gain the Inventor skill feat, even if you don't meet its prerequisites.
