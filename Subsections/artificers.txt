## During Combat Encounters...
With clever insight, you create the perfect items to give you and your allies an edge in combat. These items might allow you to target an enemy's vulnerability, reinforce armour to deflect great blows, or even grant the ability to climb shear walls. Understanding the battlefield and a robust formula book are key to your success as an artificer.

## During Social Encounters...
During social encounters, you can provide insight into magical items and aspects of crafting. You might even create items that enhance the outcomes of your social encounter.

## While Exploring...
While exploring the world you create and improvise solutions to overcome hazards and obstacles in your journey. All the while keeping an eye out for hidden arcane secrets you could use to advance your artifice.

## In Downtime...
You might create new and advanced designs for magical technology, reverse-engineer magical equipment from recent adventures, or search for advanced formulas to add to your book.

## You Might...
- Push the limits of magic theory with your applications of artifice.
- Thrive in high-pressure situations where you derive prototype items and solutions on the fly.
- Have a variety of arcane bits, tools, and dragonshards hidden in various pockets and pouches across your person.

## Others Probably...
- Are in awe of your ability to improvise a solution at a moment's notice.
- Believe you are simply a magewright rather than an adventurer.
- Fear that your artifice items are held together by nothing but spit, grit, and a whole lot of adhesive. They might be right.

. The legendary artifice class feature gives you a 10th-level imbuement slot that works a bit differently from other imbuement catalysts.
=
## Artifice
As an artificer, you understand the fundamentals of magic and can tinker with its workings. You are adept at manipulating magic's core principles to create and infuse items with powerful imbuements, bestowing them with a vast range of magical effects. Through your artifice, you can rapidly fashion powerful tools that harness the fundamental magical forces of the universe.

At 1st level, you select up to three 1st-level imbuements each morning from the imbuements in your formula book. The selected imbuements form your imbuement collection for the day. The number of imbuements you can select for your imbuement collection each day is noted in Table 6-2: Imbuement Catalysts Per Day. The only restriction is that you must select at least one 1st-level imbuement for your imbuement collection each time you prepare, ensuring that you can use all your imbuement catalysts each day.

After selecting your imbuement collection, you ready your artificer's tools to produce these imbuements on the fly. You can use Quick Artifice to create any of the imbuements in your collection by using an imbuement catalyst of an appropriate level. Upon reaching 2nd-level imbuement slots, you can heighten any imbuement in your collection to a level that matches an available imbuement catalyst.

Some of your imbuements require you to attempt a spell attack roll to see how effective they are or have your enemies roll against your spell DC (typically by attempting a saving throw). Since your key ability is Intelligence, your spell attack rolls and spell DCs use your Intelligence modifier.

### Imbuement Catalysts
In addition to your artificer's tools, your artifice is fueled by your imbuement catalysts. Imbuement catalysts are small sets of magical components, dragonshards, and precious materials primed to imbue items with magic. Each day during your daily preparations, you create up to one 1st-level imbuement catalyst. Your imbuement catalysts are expended to fuel your artifice, most importantly for the Quick Artifice activity. Your imbuement catalysts are part of the bulk of your artificer's tools.
|
As soon as you make your next daily preparations, your imbuement catalysts from the previous day lose their power and expire. While imbuement catalysts are magical physical objects, they cannot be duplicated, preserved, or created in any way other than during your daily preparations. Since imbuement catalysts are part of your unique set of tools and specialization of artifice, you cannot use any imbuement catalysts you did not prepare yourself.

As you increase in level as an artificer, the number and strength of the imbuement catalysts you can prepare increases, as shown in Table 6-2: Imbuement Catalysts Per Day.

### Imbuements
Artificers use imbuements, a unique form of magic created by infusing items with new magical effects fueled by imbuement catalysts. Although imbuements have the same rules and stat blocks as [spells](https://2e.aonprd.com/Rules.aspx?ID=259), they cannot be activated using the Cast a Spell activity or crafted into scrolls, wands, or staves. To apply an imbuement, artificers must use the Quick Artifice activity.

As an artificer, you can also learn and use spells from your spellcasting tradition as imbuements. When using a spell as an imbuement, you cannot use any target except object or surface, and if the spell statblock's range is longer than touch, it becomes touch. As a result, some spells associated with your tradition list may not be used as imbuements as they require ranges, areas, or targets other than an object or surface - this includes stat blocks that do not list an object or surface target such as Mage Armour or Longstrider.

When you gain new imbuements, you can choose to add spells from your tradition list to your formula book instead. Additionally, you can use the Learn a Spell activity to add new imbuements and spells you encounter during your adventures to your formula book. Imbuements are added using the crafting skill. 
=
### Formula book
Imbuements are precious innovations that artificers track with diligent notes. You start with a Formula Book worth 1gp or less which you receive for free. It contains all formulas for level-0 common items. In addition to crafting formulas, this formula book is your source of imbuements and contains all your notes on the imbuements you have access to, which you must study in order to prepare your imbuement collection each day. The Formula Book also gains your choice of four level-1 imbuements. Your formula book's form is up to you. It might be a grease-stained, leather-bound tome or an assortment of spellshards connected to a brass chain.

Each time you gain a level, you add three more imbuements to your formula book, of any level up to your highest arcane fundamental level. 

### Quick Artifice
When you need to create a magical device or effect on the fly, you apply your knowledge of artifice to assemble imbuement slot using the Quick Artifice activity.

item(
# Quick Artifice
---
; Artificer, Concentrate, Magical, Manipulate
**Requirements** You have the imbuement you're creating in your imbuement collection, and you're either holding or wearing artificer's tools.
-
You rapidly apply your artifice to improvise a magical device. When you use Quick Artifice, select one of the imbuements in your imbuement collection, and expend an arcane fundamental of the imbuement's level or higher. The imbuement heightened to the level of the arcane fundamental.

Quick Artifice is a special activity that takes a variable number of actions depending on the imbuement, as listed in each imbuement's stat block. As soon as the Quick Artifice activity is completed, the imbuement's effect occurs.

Some imbuements are cast as a reaction or free action. In those cases, you can use Quick Artifice as a reaction or free action (as appropriate) instead of as an activity. Such cases will be noted in the imbuement's stat block.

## Spell Replication
Using your magical ingenuity, you may attempt to improvise spell requirements for crafting even though do not have access to the Cast a Spell activity. If you have the spell in your formula book, you may supply the spell at any level up to your highest arcane fundamental as if you had the Cast a Spell activity.

In addition, you gain the [Trick Magic Item](https://2e.aonprd.com/Feats.aspx?ID=857) skill feat.

## Artifice Specialization
Artifice has many paths to mastery, and your journey has led you to a specific specialization. You may have delved deep into the fundamentals of magic at an arcane institute, honed your skills on the front line of the last war, or have started your own magewright practice developing a unique approach to artifice that set you apart from your peers. This specialization is a blend of your unique talents and expertise, which shape the way you practice artifice.

### Traditional Specialization
As a traditional artificer, you follow the established field and theories of Artifice. With long-standing techniques developed and refined by the artificers before you, your work explores and expands upon their great work.

Your spellcasting tradition is Arcane.

### Planar Specialization
As a Planar Artificer, you possess a deep knowledge of the arcane forces that underlie Eberron, and are able to channel these energies into your creations.

Instead of using standard arcane components, you may use pieces of the planes themselves to create temporary micro-manifest zones, giving you unparalleled control over the fundamental forces of reality.

Your spellcasting tradition is Primal.
=
### Spirit Specialization
As a Spirit Artificer, you have delved deep into the occult magic of the world, gaining knowledge of the mysterious and otherworldly. Your creations are imbued with eldritch powers, which you manipulate to create powerful occultic items. Instead of using conventional arcane components, you may call upon the such spirits of dolurrh to empower your items, or incorporate rare and esoteric materials into your work.

Your spellcasting tradition is Occult.

### Vassal Specialization
Vassal Artificers are masters of divine magic and specialize in infusing their creations with divine energy.

# Artificer Feats
The following are Artificer class feats you may select as you level up.
note(
# Magewright Spells
Certain feats grant you magewright spells, which are a type of focus spell. It costs 1 Focus Point to cast a focus spell. When you gain your first magewright spell, you also gain a focus pool of 1 focus point. You refill your focus pool during your daily preparations, and you regain 1 focus point by spending 10 minutes using the Refocus activity to reorganize your tools and study your formulas.

Your magewright spells always match your spellcasting tradition.

Focus spells are automatically heightened to half your level rounded up. Taking feats can give you more focus spells and increase the size of your focus pool, though your focus pool can never hold more than 3 focus points. The full rules for focus spells appear [here](https://2e.aonprd.com/Rules.aspx?ID=276).

# Metartifice
Actions with the metartifice trait are methods by which you change your Quick Artifice. You must use a metartifice action directly before the Quick Artifice action you want to alter. If you use any action (including free actions and reactions) other than Quick Artifice directly after, you waste the benefits of the metartifice action. Any additional effects added by a metartifice action are part of the spell’s effect, not of the metartifice action itself.

# Imbuement Tinker :aa:
## Feat 16
-
; Artificer, Concentrate
You’ve learned to alter choices you make when creating imbuements. After casting a spell that has a single target that offers several choices of effect (such as resist energy, spell immunity, or a polymorph spell that offers several potential forms), you can alter the choice you made when using Quick Artificer (for instance, choosing a different type of damage for resist energy). However, your tinkering weakens the imbuement’s integrity, reducing its remaining duration by half.

You can’t use this feat if the benefits of the imbuement have already been used up or if the effects of the first choice would persist in any way after switching (for instance, if one of the choices was to create a consumable item you already used, or to heal you), or if the feat would create an effect more powerful than that offered by the base imbuement. The GM is the final arbiter of what Imbuement Tinker can be applied to.

You’ve discovered how to reuse some of your imbuement catalysts over and over. You can spend 10 minutes to recycle an imbuement catalyst that you already used today, regaining access to that imbuement catalyst. The imbuement must be of 4th level or lower and one that does not have a duration. You can recycle an imbuement catalyst in this way even if you’ve already recycled that imbuement catalyst previously in the same day. The recycled imbuement catalyst can only be used for the imbuement that you originally used it for.

#### 20th (2)
item(
# TODO Imbuement Combination
## Feat 20
-
; Artificer
You can merge magic, producing multiple effects with a single imbuements. One imbuement catalyst of each level of imbuement catalyst you can have, except 2nd level and 1st level, becomes an imbuement combination slot (this doesn’t apply to cantrips). When you prepare your spells, you can fill a combination slot with a combination of two spells. Each spell in the combination must be 2 or more spell levels below the slot’s level, and both must target only one creature or object or have the option to target only one creature or object. Each spell in the combination must also have the same means of determining whether it has an effect—both spells must require a ranged spell attack roll, require the same type of saving throw, or automatically affect the target.

When you cast a combined spell, it affects only one target, even if the component spells normally affect more than one. If any spell in the combination has further restrictions (such as targeting only living creatures), you must abide by all restrictions. The combined spell uses the shorter of the component spells’ ranges. Resolve a combined spell as if were a single spell, but apply the effects of both component spells. For example, if the spell’s target succeeded at the save against a combined spell, it would apply the success effect of each spell, and if it critically failed, it would apply the critical failure effect of both spells.
