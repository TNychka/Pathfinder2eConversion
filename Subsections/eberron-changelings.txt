# Eberron Changelings ((++Eberron Changelings))
Known under the moniker of "The Children of Jes", changelings are humanoid creatures with shape-changing abilities. In particular, their abilities allow them to take the form of other humanoid creatures with little limitation.
-
)
Changelings are shapeshifters capable of replicating any other humanoid creatures near perfectly. While this talent makes them a highly-valuable asset to espionage agencies, most Changelings simply wish to make their own way with their own personas.

## You might...
- Shift your shape to a persona that matches your mood or current activity. Though you, never use a particular form for too long before moving on to the next.
- Travel light, and keep an eye on the road, never settling down - whether that be a fear of being driven away or simply a restless desire to travel.
- Take a great interest in the people around you, their stories, and their histories. After all, these new learnings might be the basis for one of your future personas.
## Others Probably...
- Others assume that because you have the uncanny ability to change their faces at will, that you will use it for malevolent ends, cheating honest folk before moving on.
- Employ you for your ability to shift your shape to any number of forms, whether this is for entertainment, acting, or protection.
- Don't understand the fluid nature you have with gender, form, or personality.

## Physical Description...
    Changelings are typically 5 to 6ft tall, weighing between 120 to 180lbs. Their base form is a nondescript humanoid shape with white skin, hair, and featureless eyes - not unlike a mannequin. Beyond this, because of their ability to shift-shape, changelings do not have a set physical description.

## Society...
Changeling society is fragmented, and no two groups of changelings have the same culture. However, for changelings that live in areas where other of their kind reside, and often shared feature is a fluidity in concepts of identity, gender, and personality.

## Alignment and Religion...
Changelings tend towards pragmatic neutrality, and few changelings embrace evil. As changelings are primarily products of the culture in which they grow, their moral alignment tends to match the alignment of their peers. Similarly, for religion, a changeling might be inclined to follow the dominant faith of their peers.

# Shift shape :aaa:
-
; concentrate,Occult,Eberron Changeling,Polymorph,Transmutation
**Frequency** Once per 10 minutes
-
You can change your appearance and your voice. You determine the specifics of the changes, including your colouration, hair length, and sex. You can also adjust your height and weight, but not so much that your size changes. You can make yourself appear as a member of another ancestry, although your game statistics do not change. You cannot duplicate the appearance of a creature you have never seen, and you must adopt a form that has the same basic arrangement of limbs that you have. However, your clothing and equipment are unchanged by this trait.
Shift shape counts as setting up a disguise for the Impersonate use of Deception; it ignores any circumstance penalties you might take for disguising yourself as a dissimilar creature, it gives you a +4 status bonus to Deception checks to prevent others from seeing that you are a shapeshifted changeling, and you add your level even if you're untrained. You can Dismiss this spell.

**Special** You stay in the new form until you use shift shape to revert to your true form or until you die.
)
note(
As per the wording of shift shape, it requires two applications of shift shape to change from one disguise to another. Once to revert to your true form, and once to shift to the new disguise.

# Changeling Heritages
Changelings are nearly homogenous in their physiology, however, the formative years of a changeling have a large impact on their future. Choose one of the following changeling heritages at 1st level.

## Changeling Traveler
You're an urban nomad, wandering from city to city. You become trained in the Society Skill (or another skill if you were already trained in Society) and gain the Streetwise skill feat. You have experience fitting into the local culture and blending with the common folk, so you're easily able to get a feel for the pulse of the local settlement. You may use the streetwise skill in any settlement in which you have spent at least a day.

## Hidden Changeling
While changelings are common in major cities, there are many villages and towns where changelings are treated with fear and suspicion. You might have been born into such a community, possibly never even knowing another changeling. As a hidden changeling, you have crafted a single identity that you consider to be your true face. You gain a +4 circumstance bonus to Impersonate checks to pretend you are of the ancestry which you were raised as. In addition, you gain the adopted ancestry feat for that ancestry.

note(
While you gain a circumstance bonus to pretend you are of an ancestry, this does not apply to deception checks you make while you are that ancestry. For instance, a human guard might be unable to see that you are not human and are a shapeshifted changeling, but might still be able to see that you are not the guard you are pretending to be.
)

## Persona Changeling
    You have developed multiple personas that have developed as entirely separate lives - and are connected to the network of changeling personas across Khorvaire. You gain the Different Worlds feat. In addition, when you approach a new community you may already be aware of local changeling personas that you can use. At the GM's discretion, make a DC 15 flat check. If you succeed, you may interact with this settlement as if you had a second identity from the Different Worlds feat, but without the benefit of the lore skill. You could have already established a persona as a priest who will receive
|
sustenance at the local temple, a folk hero who will be sheltered by the common people, or a veteran soldier who can always get a bed at the local garrison. Once this check has been made against a settlement, you may not make it again for another month.

## Watchful Changeling 
You're experienced with the deceptions of shapeshifters, given that you specialize in it. You are trained in the Deception skill (or another skill if you were already trained in Deception), and gain the Lie To Me skill feat. In addition, you gain a +2 circumstance bonus to detect polymorphed creatures.
  
# Ancestry Feats
At 1st level, you gain one ancestry feat, and you gain an additional ancestry feat every 4 levels thereafter (at 5th, 9th, 13th, and 17th levels). As a Changeling, you select from among the following ancestry feats.
#### 1st level

# Camouflage
## Feat 1

# Clawed Adaptation
## Feat 1
-
; Eberron Changeling
When you shift shape you can add claws, fangs, spines, horns, or a different natural weapon of your choice to your form. Your unarmed strikes deal 1d4 piercing or slashing damage, as appropriate to the natural weapon you chose. These attacks are in the brawling weapon group and gain the agile, finesse, and unarmed traits.

# Rapid Shift
## feat 1
-
; Eberron Changeling
You can shift your form more quickly than most Changelings. Shift Shape no longer has a maximum frequency and loses the concentrate trait.
)
item(
# Shapechanger's Intuition
## feat 1
-
; Eberron Changeling
A lifetime of experience helps you see through disguises. When you come within 10 feet of a creature that is transformed into another form or is Impersonating a specific creature, the GM rolls a secret Perception check for you to realize that the creature is transformed, even if you didn't spend an action to Seek against that creature.
)
item(
# Skin Cant
## feat 1
-
; Eberron Changeling
You are familiar with the innate language of changelings and have picked up languages beyond this. You gain the Skin Cant language and an additional common language of your choice. In addition, if you spend a week of downtime training someone, they can learn to pick up on single word messages.
)
note(
# Skin Cant
 Skin cant is a method of visual communication available only to Changelings, though others may learn to understand it. You can shift your appearance in subtle ways to communicate messages to others who understand the language. This form of communication only has the visual trait.

item(
# The Traveller's Gift
## feat 1
-
; Eberron Changeling
Have you heard of the Traveller? As a changeling whether or not you have, you have developed a knack for the Traveller's talents. Choose one cantrip from the occult spell list. You can cast this spell as an occult innate spell at will. A cantrip is heightened to a spell level equal to half your level rounded up.

item(
# Personable Performer
## feat 1
-
; Eberron Changeling
Performing for others has always been second nature to you. You gain the Virtuosic Performer skill feat. If the performance you pick is visual, you can augment your performance with a use of shift shape to take on a visually appealing form. If you do so, the circumstance bonus is +2 whether or not you are a master in performance. 
)
item(
# Wellversed Traveller
## feat 1
-
; Eberron Changeling
You have a way of communicating that leaves others hanging on your words. You become trained in Diplomacy (or another skill if you are already trained in Diplomacy). You may pick Bargain Hunter, Bon Mot, Group Impression, or Hobnobber. If you get a critical failure when using the skill feat you picked, it is a failure instead.
)
#### 5th level
item(
# Climbing Adaptation
## Feat 5
-
; Eberron Changeling
 When you use Shift Shape, you can choose one to manifest an increased climbing ability. This can be a set of claws, modified arms, or some other set of obvious physical changes that aid your climb. You gain a climb speed of 10 feet. These changes are obvious to observers.
)
item(
# Deep Shift
## Feat 5
-
; Eberron Changeling
Your ability to shape change is more than skin deep. When you use Shift Shape, the form you shift into no longer needs to have the same basic arrangement or number of limbs. You can transform into a form similar to any medium creature; humanoid, beast, or otherwise. You can add or remove limbs, digits, or even organs. Any feature added beyond your normal features (such as additional eyes, legs, or hands) is non-functional beyond the basics of keeping up appearances. Any removed features limit your physical abilities respectively. For instance, if you shift your shape to have no limbs then you similarly lose the ability to move and manipulate objects. These transformations can never modify your mental statistics.
)
=
item(
You cannot create non-fleshy materials such as chitin or metal plates. So though you could shape yourself into a construct creature, the material is very clearly flesh and is insufficient to deceive observers.

In addition, your gear does not change shape with you and may not fit the form you choose to transform into if it is significantly different (such as shift shaping from your humanoid form into a wolf).
)
note(
The intent of the deep shift feat is to allow a changeling to take on a visual appearance of any fleshy creature, and perform basic actions for the purposes of deception or performance. The shift should generally not provide any new abilities, movements, or otherwise, that a simple visual change doesn't support. Similarly, it should generally not remove standard abilities, movements, or otherwise of the character unless the new form does not support the continued use of the feature.

item(
# Emotional Empathy
## Feat 5
-
; Eberron Changeling
**Frequency** Once per minute
-
You are in tune with the emotions of those around you. You gain a +2 circumstance bonus to perception checks to sense motive. If you succeed on a sense motive check (even if it reveals nothing), you gain a +1 circumstance bonus to the next Diplomacy, Deception, or Intimidation check you make to interact with the creature.   
)
item(
# Skin Glider :r:
## Feat 5
-
; Concentrate, Eberron Changeling
**Trigger** You begin to fall more than 30 feet.
-
When you begin to fall, you're able to shift your shape to maximize your air resistance, not unlike a flying squirrel. Your fall slows to 60 feet per round. This rapid change is extremely obvious to any observers watching, and all of them become aware that you are a changeling.

**Special** If you have the Rapid Shift feat, the trigger is instead when you begin to fall more than 5 feet.

#### 9th level
item(
# Amorphous
## Feat 9
-
; Eberron Changeling
You have managed to develop a malleability that allows you to change the size of your transformations. When you shift shape, you can take on small or large forms. You are subject to the restrictions, but do not gain any bonuses from the new form (such as the ability to wield larger weapons).
)
item(
# Aquatic Adaptation
## Feat 9
-
; Eberron Changeling
**Prerequisite** Deep Shift
-
When you use Shift Shape, you can choose one to manifest gills and webbing between your fingers. You can breathe underwater and gain a swimming speed equal to your walking speed. These changes are obvious to observers.
)
item(
# Mind of the Traveller
## Feat 9
-
; Eberron Changeling
The Traveller's gifts have manifested an ability for you to read others, and see or trouble before it happens. You can cast mind reading once per day as an occult innate spell. When you do so, mind-reading loses the verbal and somatic casting requirements, and a critical failure becomes a failure instead.
)
item(
# Rapid Regeneration
## Feat 9
-
; Eberron Changeling
**Frequency** once per day
-
You're able to shift your shape to repair wounds and injuries. You gain fast healing equal to half your level for 1 minute. While Rapid Regeneration is active, you revert to your base changeling form and can't use shift shape. This counts against the frequency of your shift shape.

item(
# Skin Dancer
## Feat 9
-
; Eberron Changeling
**Prerequisite** Expert in Performance.
-
You are a master of the unique changeling art of skin dancing. You can create intricate patterns and even images on your skin, and shift them about in mesmerizing ways. You can achieve effects such as lighting coursing up your arms, or and fire dancing in a crown around your brow. You gain the Virtuosic Performer skill feat in the speciality of dance (if you already have the Virtuosic Performer in dance, you may choose an additional different speciality). When you use the Virtuosic Performer feat for dance, you gain a +1 status bonus if you augment your performance with a special use of shift shape, or +2 if you are Legendary in Performance. This use of shift shape is free as part of the performance and lasts until you shift shape again.

**Special** Skin dancer counts for the favourable form of the Personable Performer feat as well.

# Marvelous Mimic
## Feat 13
-
; Uncommon, Eberron Changeling
**Prerequisite** Deep Shift
-
Your ability to change is at a level only seen in true mimics. When you shift shape, you can take on the appearance of any Medium creature or object - within practical limits. This transformation doesn't change your statistics in any way, and you don't gain any special abilities of the form you assume (including potential functional features of an object - such as a key, ladder, rope, or crowbar).

You can recreate non-fleshy materials such as chitin or metal plates such that they are visually and tactilely deceptive to quick inspections. Materials created in this way do not have any functional properties of the material.

With a rapid change, you take on a monstrous form for an instant before shifting back. Choose any creatures that you're aware of within 30 feet as your targets. Make an Intimidation check and compare the result of the check to each target's Will DCs. It’s possible to get a different degree of success for each target. Regardless of your result, all targets are temporarily immune to your Demoralize attempts for 10 minutes.

# The Traveller's Protection :r:
## Feat 17
-
; Eberron Changeling, secret
**Frequency** Once per 10 minutes
-
With your ability to read a situation and change your form in precise and subtle ways, people second-guess whether or not they did see through disguise - as if the Traveller protects you still.

If a creature succeeds on a check to see through your impersonation, you become aware of their increasing disbelief. The GM will make you aware that a creature succeeded on their check. You may choose to use the Traveller's protection to force a reroll of the dice to take the lower of the two options. If you do so, their check gains the misfortune trait, and the outcome of this new roll is a secret to you. 

Similarly, if you fail an impersonation check against a creature, you are aware of your blunder. The GM will make you aware that you have failed the check, and you may choose to use the Traveller's protection to force a reroll to take the higher of the two options. If you do so, the check gains the fortune trait, and the outcome of this new roll is a secret to you.
