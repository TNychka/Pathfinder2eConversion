## Bugbears ((+Bugbears))
Dhakaani bugbears are known as Guul’dar, “strong folk,” and are celebrated for their strength and courage. Though they appear slow, they are capable of great bursts of strength or speed when necessary. Many yearn to prove their mettle on the battlefield, risking their lives to earn the glory known as atcha. Others instead find themselves at peace in small isolated clans, moving in flow with the nature around them.
)
Bugbears are storybook monsters in the tales and nightmares of many peoples. Stories speak of bugbears as great, hairy beasts that lurk in the shadows - waiting silently to spring their ambush. That if you stay off the beaten path or wander too far from your parents, a bugbear will reach out of the shadows and silently strangle you. If you leave the protection of your town at night, bugbears will drag you to their den to devour you alive. If a bugbear cuts off your head, your soul will never reach dolurrh.

These terrible stories of bugbears flowered from seeds of truth. Most bugbears rely on stealth and strength to attack, using great bursts of energy to end fights before the enemy is even aware they are there. Most bugbears even prefer to work at night, aiding their natural stealth despite their great size. While there are stories of bugbear mercenaries taking heads of enemy leaders during the last war, bugbears are no more likely to eat people indiscriminately than humans are. As for the bugbears of the forests, many follow the peace and flow of nature rather than the violence of war. There are many a story of stoic bugbear rangers or druids guiding lost troops through impossible terrain to safety during the war.

Now, as the nation of Darguun forms out of the ashes of the last war, the Guul'dar once again have an increasing presence in the civilized parts of the continent of Khorvaire.
## You might...
- Present an air of indolence the hides the vicious ferocity you display in battle.
- Use your great strength, long limbs, and endurance to perform feats of athletics that few others are capable of.
- Move slowly and in time with the world around you, listening and waiting until the time is right to expend your energy.
|
## Others Probably...
- Walk and talk cautiously around you, in fear of invoking your ire.
- Look to use your might to their advantage, assuming that you are easily outsmarted.
- Underestimate your silent step - assuming that your great mass could not possibly move as quietly as the stories say.

## Physical Description...
These stealthy and strong goblinoid creatures can thrive in the mayhem of battle and move slowly with the world around them - conserving great reserves of energy until needed. Standing between 6 to 8 feet tall and 250 to 300lbs, bugbears outsize most humanoids that they meet. Bugbears are typically extremely muscular, able to lift and move great weights with their long limbs. They are covered in thick short yellowish fur and share the same pointed ears as their goblinoid cousins. Using their long limbs bugbears can wield weapons with greater reach than most.

Despite their great size, Bugbears show an uncanny ability to sneak up on the unsuspecting. They can use their quiet step and darkvision to move quietly through the night. Unnoticed if they so desire.

Bugbears reach physical adulthood around the age of 16, and they can live up to 80 years. However, given that most strive for glory in battle or perform dangerous manual labour, death by old age is relatively uncommon among Bugbears.

## Society...
The goblinoid society of Darguun is "bound together both by the philosophy of muut and atcha and by the spiritual connection of the Uul Dhakaan. Their lives are shaped by a relentless martial culture and a rigid caste system."[1]

"Muut is typically translated as 'duty,' though it can also be seen as 'the honor of the empire'— something everyone must work to maintain. Muut is what is expected of you, what you owe to your comrades. Dhakaani don’t expect thanks for doing something that has to be done; rather, they are disgusted by those who shirk their responsibilities. The closest dar equivalent to “thank you” is ta muut, which simply means, 'You do your duty.'

By contrast, atcha refers to 'personal honor' or 'glory,' an opportunity to exceed what is required of you. No dar is content to simply do what is expected; the quest for atcha is a powerful driving force that urges dar to chase their full potential. In battle, the exhortation paatcha means, 'This is a chance to gain honor!'"[2] 

However, not all bugbears are part of the Dhakaani, and many of these bugbears are integrated with the cultures around them. Some may have adopted the human cultures of the cities in which they were born or the druidic customs of their isolated clans in the forests of the world.

)
## Alignment and Religion...
The Alignment and Religion of an individual bugbear depends on the culture in which they were raised. For the bugbears of the Dhakaani empire, their alignment is driven to a lawful behaviour as fits their spiritual connection to the empire.

"The general mindset of the dar is ill-suited to the abstract concept of faith, whether in higher powers or the world itself. They believe in the past. They believe in their leaders. But they don’t believe that there are cosmic powers or prophecies that control fate."[3]

## Names...
Goblinoid names often feature drawn-out vowel sounds (represented by doubled letters), as seen in the names of both their ancient empire (Dhakaan) and their newborn country (Darguun). Goblins, hobgoblins, and bugbears use the same names and naming conventions, despite their tribal differences.[4]
