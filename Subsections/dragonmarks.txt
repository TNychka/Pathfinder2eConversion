## Dragonmarks ((Dragonmarks))
With a flash from the Dragonmark of a Dennith heir, the swing of a blade is deflected at the last moment. As a peace negotiation comes to a close, the glow of a Mark of Detection stops a hidden blade from ending it in war. Dragonmarks are powers that the heirs of twelve houses use to empower their skillset and specialize in their fields.
-
)
    Dragonmarks are arcane symbols that have appeared on seven of Khorvaire's common races. They are more intricate than a birthmark but more distinct than a tattoo. Dragonmarks are weaved of blue, green, and purple so vivid they seem to glow even without producing light. Scholars still aren't sure as to the origins of Dragonmarks, yet their effect on the world is undeniable. 
   
    Of the thirteen true dragonmarks that once existed, twelve true dragonmarks remain. Each family that manifested one of the true marks grouped together with the other families that manifested the same mark to form a house. With the power of their shared marks, these powerful bloodline houses control large pieces of the economy of Khorvaire.  Though the houses are bound by the laws of the Korth Edict, in the wake of the last war the boundaries of these laws are being tested. If you bear a mark, it is up to you to decide how you relate to these powerful dragonmarked dynasties.

## Dragonmark Focus Spells ((+Dragonmark Focus Spells))
    Dragonmarks are unique in that they provide arcane specialization in specific and limited areas. Since it is possible to have focus points from multiple sources, any source that provides focus points with the dragonmark trait cannot be combined with any focus point sources that do not have the dragonmark trait. The reverse is also true. Dragonmark focus points should effectively be considered a unique pool, with a proficiency rank for spell attack rolls and spell DCs.  All dragonmark focus spells are considered to be of the arcane tradition.
    
    Generally, dragonmarks follow all the rules for focus spells which appear on page 300 of the Core Rule book, including heightening, refocusing, and multiple point sources. Dragonmark focus spells don't require spell slots, and you can't cast them using spell slots. Certain feats can give you more dragonmark focus spells and increase the size of your dragonmark focus pool, though your dragonmark focus pool can never hold more than 3 dragonmark focus points. It costs 1 dragonmark focus point to cast a dragonmark focus spell. You refill your dragonmark focus pool during your daily preparations, and you can regain 1 dragonmark focus point by
=
    spending 10 minutes using the refocus activity to recharge the powers of your dragonmark. Dragonmark focus spells are automatically heightened to half your level rounded up unless otherwise noted  - such as by limitations of the power of your mark.

# Manifesting a Dragonmark
Despite the rigorous study of dragonmarks, it is not entirely understood how marks manifest. 
  
Children are not born with their marks. Rather, a dragonmark most often appears in response to a stressful situation in which the powers of the mark could prove useful. A Deneith heir feels her dragonmark flare to life as her best friend would take a mortal wound. A Lyrandar scion instinctively dashes across the ropes of a storm tossed ship, and in an instant of burning pain, their mark appears. However, this is not exclusively the case. Sometimes marks will appear later in life, or even never manifest.
  
If a dragonmark does appear, often the mark will manifest first as the least mark. Through study and focus the bearer increases their power, and the dragonmark similarly increases in size and complexity. As their power grows, the marks channel not just stronger powers, but additional abilities. Though most marks start as least marks, some will manifest a lesser mark or even greater mark without explanation. As a GM, you can consider allowing players to bypass the prerequisites or level of a dragonmark feat. If you do not meet the prerequisites or level of the dragonmarked feat, it gains the Rare trait instead of Uncommon.

Your family is influential and powerful, and you have the connections to fast track your requests of the house. When you make a request of your house, it may be to any house member whether they know you or not, as long as they are at least indifferent towards you. For any request for a favour that the house performs such acquiring important information, introductions to important people, or the loan of equipment or personnel, you gain a +1 circumstance bonus. A lesser mark grants you a +2 circumstance bonus, a greater mark grants you a +3 circumstance bonus, and a siberys mark grants you a +4 circumstance bonus.

# Test of Siberys
## Feat 3
-
; Unique, General, Dragonmark
**Prerequisites** You do not have a Dragonmark, your house is willing to run your test
-
The Test of Siberys is a rite of passage undertaken by the adolescent children of the dragonmarked houses. It is rumoured to induce the kind of extreme stress needed for dragonmarks to manifest. The test varies from house to house and is based both on the powers of the mark and the traditions of the family. Outsiders, even those of dragonmarked houses, know little of what goes on in a particular house’s test. Though a person can fail the test and still manifest a mark at a later age, this is rare. As a rule, it is assumed that those who fail will never develop a dragonmark. TODO

If you choose the Test of Siberys, your character must undergo the test associated with their mark. _If_ you succeed, gain the Least Mark ancestry feat.
)
note(
# Awarding the feat
A character can only gain the benefits of the Test of Siberys _if_ they pass the test. A GM should run this as a personal challenge to the player, customized depending on their house. This challenge has a good chance of failure and even the potential of death. When a player would select this feat, do not grant them the bonus of a mark yet. Instead - as soon as reasonably possible in game - they should take the Test of Siberys. On a failure, have the player select a different feat in its place. They may not (except under extraordinary circumstances) ever attempt the test again.

# Higher levels
If a character takes this general feat at a higher level, such as 7th, you can consider allowing them to manifest any dragonmark of a lower level. However, the stakes associated with manifesting a higher level mark should increase accordingly.

Additonally you may choose to expend one charge of your dragonmark focus pool to transfer as many of your remaining hit points to marked creature as you wish. You cannot reduce your own hit points below 0 or raise the target's hit point total above its maximum.
)
item(
# Mark of Destiny
## feat 19
-
; Dragonmark, Fortune, General
**Prerequisites** siberys mark

**Frequency** once per day
-
You can use your Siberys mark to bend fate itself. You may invoke the mark of destiny in two circumstances.

First, you may expend one charge of your dragonmarked focus pool to reroll a check. You must use the second result. 
Second, if you have at least 2 dragonmarked focus points you may expend them all to avoid death. You can do this when your dying condition would increase. You lose the dying condition entirely and stabilize with 0 Hit Points. You don’t gain the wounded condition or increase its value from losing the dying condition in this way, but if you already had that condition, you don’t lose it or decrease its value.

# Dragonmarked Houses ((Dragonmarked Houses))
As individual families manifested dragonmarks, each joined together with other families of like marks to form houses. These houses grew, and have become powerful dragonmarked dynasties.

# House Cannith ((+House Cannith))
House Cannith has risen to dominate commerce and industry in Khorvaire. For every advance made in magic, odds are good that Cannith had a hand in it—from everbright lanterns to the lightning rail, from the warforged to the secret experiments now lost deep within the wastes of the Mournland.
With its power and creative genius, the house commands both respect and fear. Despite its accomplishments, however, Cannith stands in turmoil. Unable to agree on a new ruler in the aftermath of the Day of Mourning, the house splintered into three factions, each with its own agenda. This rift has caused unease among the houses and beyond, giving monarchs and entrepreneurs pause even as they cautiously back one of three would-be leaders.

When you create a device, choose one of the following options:

Clockwork Toy. This toy is a clockwork animal, monster, or person, such as a frog, mouse, bird, dragon, or soldier. When placed on the ground, the toy moves 5 feet across the ground on each of your turns in a random direction. It makes noises as appropriate to the creature it represents.

Fire Starter. The device produces a miniature flame, which you can use to light a candle, torch, or campfire. Using the device requires your action.

Music Box. When opened, this music box plays a single song at a moderate volume.
The box stops playing when it reaches the song’s end or when it is closed.

You then touch a Tiny nonmagical object as an action and give it one of the following magical properties of your choice:

    The object sheds bright light in a 5-foot radius and dim light for an additional 5 feet.
    Whenever tapped by a creature, the object emits a recorded message that can be heard up to 10 feet away. You utter the message when you bestow this property on the object, and the recording can be no more than 6 seconds long.
    The object continuously emits your choice of an odor or a nonverbal sound (wind, waves, chirping, or the like). The chosen phenomenon is perceivable up to 10 feet away.
    A static visual effect appears on one of the object’s surfaces. This effect can be a picture, up to 25 words of text, lines and shapes, or a mixture of these elements, as you like.

The chosen property lasts indefinitely. As an action, you can touch the object and end the property early.

You can bestow magic on multiple objects, touching one object each time you use this feature, though a single object can only bear one property at a time. The maximum number of objects you can affect with this feature at one time is equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of one object). If you try to exceed your maximum, the oldest property immediately ends, and then the new property applies.

Aberrant marks are unique in that no two marks are the same, though they might produce similar effects. See the notes on Building a Spell list for how you might work with your GM to customize your mark.
)

## Aberrant Mark [Uncommon Versatile (Dragonmarked Ancestries) Heritage]
Aberrant marks often appear when people from different dragonmarked families produce a child, and for this reason, such unions are forbidden by the Twelve. However, Aberrant marks can appear at any time on any ancestry that has not already manifested a dragonmark. You gain the dragonmarked heritage, and the Aberrant Mark traits, in addition to the traits from your ancestry. If you are a half-elf or half-orc, you gain those respective traits as well. In addition, you can pick from your original ancestry, dragonmarked heritage, and aberrant mark feats whenever you gain an ancestry feat.

# The Dangers of the Aberrant
During the war of the mark, the dragonmarked houses united to exterminate those with aberrant marks, significantly reducing their numbers. Survivors of the war had marks that had much weaker powers. 

Although aberrant marks are no longer hunted by the houses as during the War of the Mark, the fear of the aberrant marks persists. Since the Day of Mourning, the number of aberrant dragonmarks has begun to increase which has begun to cause some alarm in the Twelve. If a player character manifests a powerful mark and catches the attention of the Twelve, they may find themselves targeted for removal once again.

## Aberrant Mark Focus Spells
If you manifest a mark, you will begin to gain access to the following aberrant mark focus spells. As the powers of your mark are heightened, the powers and variety of spells will increase as well.

## Building a spell list
While Aberrant marks are chaotic and destructive, they tend to follow a theme. Some ideas of potential themes are Acid, Plagues, Curses, Fire, Ice, Mental Assaults, or Blood Bending. When building your Corrupted Replication, you should pick spells that follow a general format - even if it might be suboptimal. Part of the balance of dragonmarks is that they don't always provide the strongest effect that they can at their level.

When building the Heightened Level list, spells should be placed at the heightened level one higher than their base spell level ie. Acid Storm, a 5th level spell should be placed at Heightened Level 6. Only rarely should the spell be placed at its actual level. You get one spell per level. Start with spells from the following list.

**Heightened Level** | **Spell**
--- | :---
2 | Acidic Burst, Agitate, Burning hands, Charm, Chilling Spray, Fear, Grease, Grim Tendrils, Noxious Vapors, Phantom Pain
3 | Animated Assault, Blood Vendetta, Feast of Ashes, Flaming Sphere, Ghoulish Cravings, Harm, Slough Skin
4 | Agonizing Despair, Blindness, Cup of Dust, Curse of Lost Time, Faerie Fire, Hypnotic Pattern, Lightning Bolt, Paralyze, Paranoia, Stinking Cloud, Sudden Blight, Vampiric Touch

# Excoriate ((+Excoriate))
## Background
-
; Rare
The dragonmarked houses have their own laws, some older than Galifar. A heir who violates the laws of a house is made an excoriate: stripped of the house name and forbidden from drawing on house resources. An excoriate must surrender their signet ring, any other property that can be claimed as a gift of the house, and the name of both house and family. Their likeness is circulated through the major enclaves of the house. Heirs of their house are forbidden to provide them with aid or succor, and the other houses typically shun excoriates of any line. Excoriation is a rare punishment, but is often a fate worse than prison for a dragonmarked heir. 

Choose three ability boosts. One must be to Intelligence or Wisdom, and two are free ability boosts.
You're trained the skill related to your house (table 1-1), and the Lore of Dragonmarked Houses. You gain the associated skill feat related to your house.

Any dragonmarked member of your house who knows of your status is automatically unfriendly toward you, as are most members of other dragonmarked houses who are aware that you are a excoriate. You are typically refused service in establishments owned by your house or its guilds. Members of your house are forbidden from providing you with any sort of aid or support. You may not use the name of your house or family. Should you present yourself as a member of your house, you could be prosecuted for fraud. In addition, you cannot make use of feats that require the support of your house for training, such as the Favored in House feat, or Dragonmarked Scion archetype.

item(
# House Orphan ((+House Orphan))
## Background
-
The Korth Edicts prevent members of a dragonmarked house from holding land, noble title, or rank in a national military. Over the centuries, a number of dragonmarked heirs have chosen to give up their birthright to be freed from the edicts. During the Last War, a number of idealistic heirs left their houses to fight for one of the Five Nations. Others have married into noble families, whether for love or greed. 

Depending on their reasons for departure, an orphan could have a specific set of enemies within their house or might have had a perfectly amicable parting of the ways. However, an orphan is restricted from using their family or house name. They might not be an outcast, but they have surrendered their birthright just the same. It is more difficult for an orphan to gain access house training such as the Dragonmarked Scion, but not impossible. Outside of the house, you decided to choose your own path.

A scion can obtain room and board at any house enclave, though they is expected to put in a few hours of work in exchange. The scion does not have access to any special resources, but can usually find work at a guild business.

Every dragonmarked house is involved in dozens of schemes and plots. Some of these are deep secrets that could threaten the existence of the house if exposed; others are practical quests designed to turn a profit. Agents take on assignments requested by their house: they are adventurers who dedicate their lives to expanding the power and influence of their dragonmarked families. An agent can be called into the service of their house at any time, but how this servitude affects the rest of the party is an important question.

A dragonmarked agent bears the name of their house and, if they carry a dragonmark, can use the honorary title of lord.

# Foundling
## Background
-
Characters can develop dragonmarks only by virtue of blood ties to a dragonmarked house, and many dragonmarked discover their lineage only after the mark appears. Some are the descendants of excoriates, while others are the product of a doomed romance. Whatever their stories, these foundlings carry dragonmarks but have no connection to their houses. 
All the dragonmarked houses seek to identify and recruit foundlings. A house might occasionally refuse to accept a foundling, typically in cases involving descendants of truly infamous excoriates. As a rule, though, the houses all want to expand their ranks.

Choose two ability boosts. One must be to Charisma or Wisdom, and one is a free ability boost.

Despite never recieving formal training, your dragonmarked blood has inclined you to learn the skill related to your house. Without the formal training of your house however, you instead develop a Lore related to that skill rather than the dragonmarked houses.

# Dragonmark Focus Items ((Dragonmark Focus Items))
)
## Dragonmark focus items
Much of the influence of the dragonmarked houses is based on a simple principle: it’s easier to amplify an existing magical effect, such as that of a dragonmark, than to create the same effect from nothing. Taken on their own, the powers granted by dragonmarks aren’t overwhelmingly powerful. However, over the course of centuries, House Cannith and the Twelve have developed items that focus and enhance the powers of the mark to produce powerful, reliable effects. In many cases—such as the storm spires of House Lyrandar and the creation forges of House Cannith—the Arcane Congress has been unable to duplicate the effects of these powerful focus items for non-dragonmarked creatures. Other items have since been reproduced in forms that anyone can use, but an item that requires the user to possess a specific dragonmark is always easier to create and less expensive than one that produces the same effect for anyone, giving the dragonmarked houses an important advantage.

Dragonmark focus items are rarely sold in stores. They can only be created using proprietary tools, and are produced exclusively by House Cannith and the Twelve for use by trusted agents of the dragonmarked houses. So while many Medani inquisitives wear Medi spectacles, they acquired them through service to the house, not by purchasing them with gold. While a dragonmark focus item usually has the same general appearance as the item whose effects it duplicates, it bears the image of the required mark somewhere on the item and often carries the sigil of the associated house. Siberys dragonshards are a vital component of focus items, most including a shard in some form. With that said, a focus item’s design can differ from the usual magic item’s form—the serpentine mirror has a similar effect to a crystal ball, but it’s a flat mirror as opposed to an orb.

The following items are Dragonmark focus items. They function identically to the duplicated item, however, their level is reduced by 1. The price, but no other statistics are similarly reduced to the new level. All these items gain the Invested, and Dragonmark trait. You may only invest in the item if you have the requisite dragonmark.

The dragonmarked houses form the foundation of Khorvaire’s magical economy, and they’re the source of many of the magic items you can buy in the Five Nations. 90% of potions of healing are either made by House Jorasco or produced according to their specifications. If you have two +1 shortswords produced by a Cannith forge, they’ll be essentially identical, while an Aereni shortsword would be lovingly crafted by a particular artisan. In dealing with house products, consider whether the item is military or civilian. During the war, a large portion of House Cannith’s manufactured goods were designed for military use. If you buy a cloak of protection from a Cannith dealer in Sharn, is it an elegant model made for a noble to wear to the Tain Gala, or is it a Brelish Bear cloak, originally issued to an elite commando? If an item is essentially a tool of war, then it may have actually been used in the war; if so, which nation was it made for? Is it legitimate surplus? Was it likely sold by a retired soldier, or salvaged from a battlefield? Military gear is often more functional than decorative. It may bear the markings of a particular nation, and it may show signs of use. On the other hand, civilian products need to lure in customers. Consider a potion of healing. The potions Jorasco sold to the Brelish army were known as “coppers” because of the coppery taste of the fluid, and the potency is marked for accurate administration; a Brelish soldier might call a superior potion of healing a “copper-3.” By contrast, a civilian potion of healing could be called something like “Vivacity,” with a shiny label and available in a variety of flavours. You might find a barker in a part of town where the people are wealthy enough to buy such a product. “Feeling worn down? Perhaps you’ve had a little fall? Get back on your feet with a shot of Vivacity!”
