# Dragonmarks ((Dragonmarks))
With a flash from the Dragonmark of a Deneith heir, the swing of a blade is deflected at the last moment. As a peace negotiation comes to a close, the glow of a Mark of Detection stops a hidden blade from ending it in war. Dragonmarks are powers that the heirs of twelve houses use to empower their skillset and specialize in their fields.
-
)
    Dragonmarks are arcane symbols marked on the skin of seven of Khorvaire's common races. Dragonmarks are weaved of blue, green, and purple streaks so vivid, that they seem to glow even without producing light
    As marks manifested on the peoples of Khorvaire, they did so exclusively in specific bloodlines. Each of these bloodlines has since joined with all other bloodlines of the same type of mark to form a dragonmarked house - gaining complete monopoly over the use of their mark in the world. With the power of their marks, these powerful houses now control large pieces of the economy of Khorvaire.

## Dragonmarks ((+Dragonmarks))
    Dragonmarks provide arcane power related to a specific and limited area of specialization. Depending on its type, a dragonmark will produce effects related to Detection, Finding, Handling, Healing, Hospitality, Making, Passage, Scribing, Sentinel, Storm, or Warding. The powers manifested by dragonmarks are spell-like effects, the variety and strength of these powers increase with your power, and the size of the dragonmark itself. These powers granted to you by your dragonmark, are in the form of Dragonmark Spells. 

### Dragonmark Spells
    When you select a Dragonmarked Heritage, you do not start with Dragonmark Spells. When you gain a Dragonmark, it will grant you Dragonmark Spells which are a type of focus spell. It costs 1 Focus Point to cast a focus spell, and the Dragonmark grants you a focus pool of 1 Focus Point. You refill your focus pool during your daily preparations, and you can regain 1 Focus Point by spending 10 minutes using the Refocus activity to restore the powers of your dragonmark.
    Focus spells are automatically heightened to half your level rounded up. Focus spells don't require spell slots, nor can you cast them using spell slots. Certain feats can give you more focus spells and increase the size of your focus pool, though your focus pool can never hold more than 3 Focus Points. The full rules for focus spells appear [here](https://2e.aonprd.com/Rules.aspx?ID=276).
    All Dragonmark Focus Spells are considered to be of the arcane tradition, though use their own Dragonmark proficiency. When you gain a Dragonmark Focus Pool - while most dragonmarks use Charisma as their spellcasting ability modifier - you may choose to instead use either Intelligence or Wisdom. You may not change which spellcasting ability modifier you use once you have selected it.
    Dragonmarks are unique in that they provide arcane specialization in specific and limited areas, and originate directly from your Dragonmark. All Dragonmark Focus Spells require the Dragonmark component. This component is supplied by the dragonmark itself, and so long as nothing is interfering with the dragonmark's powers, the component is automatically provided for the casting of the spell. When the dragonmark component is provided, it is evidently visible as the dragonmark glows with a dim light and shifts about on the caster's skin.

right(
# Manifesting a Dragonmark
Despite the rigorous study of dragonmarks, it is not entirely understood how marks manifest. If a dragonmark does appear, often the mark will manifest first as the least mark. Through study and focus the bearer increases their power, and the dragonmark similarly increases in size and complexity. As their power grows, the marks channel not just stronger powers, but additional abilities.
# Bypassing Prerequisites
Though most marks start as Least Marks, some will manifest a Lesser Mark or even Greater Mark without explanation. Siberys marks in particular have been known to manifest on previously unmarked individuals. As a GM, you can consider allowing players to bypass the prerequisites or level of a dragonmark feat. If the prerequisites or level of the dragonmarked feat is not met, it gains the Rare trait. When bypassing requirements in this way, assume that each of the prerequisite feats has also been gained for the purposes of Dragonmark Pool size and Dragonmark Focus Spell selection.

You begin to craft an item as if using the Craft activity, but with the empowering effects of your dragonmark guiding you, your efficiency is increased exponentially. 
    When you begin the Craft activity, you can cast Construction Savant as part of your activity. When you have spent a full day of the Craft Activity under the effects of Construction Savant, you may immediately make the Craft activity check to complete the item. On a critical success, you can finish the item, bypassing any remaining time to its completion as if you had completed the prerequisite days of work. Otherwise, you may continue on the item again the next day without any penalty. If you use Construction Savant on your last day of work, you instead gain a +1 status bonus to the final crafting check. Once the item is completed, it follows the rules of the crafting activity to reduce cost which Construction Savant may not assist with.

# Aberrant Mark ((+Aberrant Mark))
The twelve dragonmarks are predictable, and their powers are generally constructive. But there is another kind of dragonmark, which is dangerous to both the bearer and the people around them. Aberrant dragonmarks can appear on members of any race, at any age, regardless of bloodline. No two aberrant dragonmarks are exactly alike-even if they grant the same power, they manifest in different ways.
-
)
Aberrant marks are unique - no two marks are the same - though they might produce similar effects. See the notes on Building a Spell list for how you might work with your GM to customize your mark.

Aberrant Mark is a versatile Heritage, which can only be applied to the following ancestries: Dwarf, Elf, Gnome, Human, Human (Half-Elf), Human (Half-Orc), or Halfling. By picking this Heritage at first level you gain access to all of the Mark of Aberrant Mark ancestry feats.

## Aberrant Mark [Uncommon Versatile (Dragonmarked Ancestries) Heritage]
Aberrant marks can appear at any time on any ancestry that has not already manifested a dragonmark. You gain the Dragonmarked Heritage, and the Aberrant Mark traits, in addition to the traits from your ancestry. In addition, you can pick from your original ancestry, dragonmarked heritage, and aberrant mark feats whenever you gain an ancestry feat. 

**Special:** If you are a half-elf, this heritage replaces the half-elf heritage, though you still gain the elf trait, the half-elf trait, and low-light vision. In addition, you can select elf, half-elf, and human, dragonmarked heritage, and aberrant mark feats whenever you gain an ancestry feat.

**Special:** If you are a half-orc, this heritage replaces the half-orc heritage, though you still you gain the orc trait, the half-orc trait, and low-light vision. In addition, you can select orc, half-orc, human, dragonmarked heritage, and aberrant mark feats whenever you gain an ancestry feat.

## Aberrant Mark Focus Spells
If you manifest a mark, you will begin to gain access to the following aberrant mark focus spells. As the powers of your mark are heightened, the powers and variety of spells will increase as well.
|
### Aberrant Feedback ((++Aberrant Feedback))
One of the reasons that aberrant marks are so feared, is their potential for causing unintentional harm resulting from their use. The Aberrant Feedback trait applies to most spells that an aberrant mark can cast. 

After you cast a focus spell with the Aberrant Feedback trait, you must make DC 5 flat check. On a failure, you increase your drained condition by 1. On a critical failure, a random creature within 30 feet of the caster (potentially including the caster) takes 1d4 persistent acid, cold, fire, bleeding, or poison damage of the GM's choice. This is in addition to increasing the caster's drained condition. The number of damage dice increases to two with a Lesser Mark, three with a Greater Mark, and four with a Siberys Mark.

note(
#### Consider the following
If Aberrant Feedback is undesirable for your play style, consider awarding the Aberrant Control feat for free or with training from House Tarkanan or by learning from another Aberrant Marked NPC. 

Alternatively, if you wish to keep Aberrant Feedback but simplify your combat loop, ignore the natural 1 clause of Aberrant Feedback.

## Building a spell list
While Aberrant marks are generally chaotic and destructive, they tend to follow a theme. Some potential themes are Acid, Blood Bending, Plagues, Curses, Fire, Ice, Mental Assaults, or Vermin. When building your Corrupted Replication, you should pick spells that follow a general format - even if it might be suboptimal. Part of the balance of dragonmarks is that they don't always provide the strongest effect that they can at their level.

When building the Heightened Level list, spells should be placed at the heightened level one higher than their base spell level. For example, Acid Storm, a 5th level spell should be placed at Heightened Level 6. Only rarely should the spell be placed at its actual level. You get one spell per level. Start with spells from the following list.
**Heightened Level** | **Spell**
