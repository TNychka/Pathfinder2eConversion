## Dragonmarks ((Dragonmarks))
With a flash from the Dragonmark of a Dennith heir, the swing of a blade is deflected at the last moment. As a peace negotiation comes to a close, the glow of a Mark of Detection stops a hidden blade from ending it in war. Dragonmarks are powers that the heirs of twelve houses use to empower their skillset and specialize in their fields.
-
)
    Dragonmarks are arcane symbols that have appeared on seven of Khorvaire's common races. They are more intricate than a birthmark but more distinct than a tattoo. Scholars still aren't sure as to the origins of Dragonmarks, yet their effect on the world is undeniable. 
    Of the thirteen true dragonmarks that once existed, twelve families of dragonmarks remain. With the power of marks, these powerful bloodlines have formed houses that control large pieces of the economy of Khorvaire. Though the houses are bound by the laws of the Korth Edict, in the wake of the last war the boundaries of these laws are being tested. Though you bear a mark, it is up to you to decide how you relate to these powerful dragonmarked dynasties.

## Dragonmark Focus Spells ((+Dragonmark Focus Spells))
    Dragonmarks are unique in that they provide arcane specialization, but only one specific area. Since it is possible to have focus points from multiple sources, any source that provides focus points with the Dragonmark trait cannot be combined with any focus point sources that do not have the Dragonmark trait. The reverse is also true. Dragonmark focus points should effectively be considered a unique pool, with a proficiency rank for spell attack rolls and spell DCs.  All Dragonmark focus spells are considered to be of the Arcane tradition.
    Generally, Dragonmarks follow all the rules for focus spells, including heightening, refocusing, and multiple point sources. It costs 1 Dragonmark Focus Point to cast a Dragonmark focus spell. You refill your Dragonmark focus pool during your daily preparations, and you can regain 1 Dragonmark Focus Point by spending 10 minutes using the Refocus activity to recharge the powers of your Dragonmark. Dragonmark Focus spells are automatically heightened to half your level rounded up unless otherwise noted  - such as by limitations of the power of your mark.
    Dragonmark Focus spells don't require spell slots, and you can't cast them using spell slots. Certain feats can give you more Dragonmark focus spells and increase the size of your Dragonmark focus pool, though your Dragonmark focus pool can never hold more than 3 Dragonmark Focus Points. Dragonmark focus spells follow all rules for focus spells which appear on page 300 of the Core Rule book, but may not be combined with any feats that do not have the dragonmark trait.

# Manifesting a Dragonmark
Despite the rigorous study of dragonmarks, it is not entirely understood how marks manifest. 
  
Children are not born with their marks. Rather, a dragonmark most often appears in response to a stressful situation in which the powers of the mark could prove useful. A Jorasco heir feels her dragonmark flare to life as her best friend lies dying. A Medani scion instinctively realizes the meal he is about to eat is poisoned, and in an instant of burning pain, the mark appears. However, this is not exclusively the case. Sometimes marks will appear later in life, or even never manifest.
  
If a dragonmark does appear, often the mark will manifest first as the least mark. Through study and focus the bearer increases their power, and the dragonmark similarly increases in size and complexity. As their power grows, the marks channel not just stronger powers, but additional abilities. Though most marks start as least marks, some will manifest a lesser mark or even greater mark without explanation. As a GM, you can consider allowing players to bypass the prerequisites or level of a dragonmark feat. If you do not meet the prerequisites or level of the dragonmarked feat, it gains the Rare trait instead of Uncommon.

item(
# Test of Siberys
## Feat 3
-
; Unique, General, Dragonmark
**Prerequisites** You do not have a Dragonmark
-
The Test of Siberys is a rite of passage undertaken by the adolescent children of the dragonmarked houses. It is rumoured to induce the kind of extreme stress needed for dragonmarks to manifest. The test varies from house to house and is based both on the powers of the mark and the traditions of the family. Outsiders, even those of dragonmarked houses, know little of what goes on in a particular house’s test. Though a person can fail the test and still manifest a mark at a later age, this is rare. As a rule, it is assumed that those who fail will never develop a dragonmark.

If you choose the Test of Siberys, your character should undergo the test associated with their mark. _If_ you succeed, gain the Least Mark ancestry feat.
)
note(
If a character takes this general feat at a higher level, such as 7th, you can consider allowing them to manifest any dragonmark of a lower level. However, the stakes associated with manifesting a higher level mark should increase accordingly.

# Aberrant Mark ((+Aberrant Mark))
The twelve dragonmarks are predictable, and their powers are generally constructive. But there is another kind of dragonmark, which is dangerous to both the bearer and the people around them. Aberrant dragonmarks can appear on members of any race, at any age, regardless of bloodline. No two aberrant dragonmarks are exactly alike—even if they grant the same power, they manifest in different ways.
)

Aberrant Mark is a versatile Heritage, which can only be applied to the following ancestries: Dwarf, Elf, Gnome, Human, Half-Elf, Half-Orc, or Halfling. By picking this Heritage at first level you gain access to all of the Mark of Aberrant Mark ancestry feats.

# Unique Marks
Aberrant marks are unique in that no two marks are the same, though they might produce similar effects. See the notes on Building a Spell list for how you might work with your GM to customize your mark.
)

## Aberrant Mark [Uncommon Versatile (Dragonmarked Ancestries) Heritage]
Aberrant marks often appear when people from different dragonmarked families produce a child, and for this reason, such unions are forbidden by the Twelve. However, Aberrant marks can appear at any time on any ancestry that has not already manifested a dragonmark. You gain the dragonmarked heritage, and the Aberrant Mark traits, in addition to the traits from your ancestry. If you are a half-elf or half-orc, you gain those respective traits as well. In addition, you can pick from your original ancestry, dragonmarked heritage, and aberrant mark feats whenever you gain an ancestry feat.

right(
# The Dangers of the Aberrant
During the war of the mark, the dragonmarked houses united to exterminate those with aberrant marks, significantly reducing their numbers. Survivors of the war had marks that had much weaker powers. 

Although aberrant marks are no longer hunted by the houses as during the War of the Mark, the fear of the aberrant marks persists. Since the Day of Mourning, the number of aberrant dragonmarks has begun to increase which has begun to cause some alarm in the Twelve. If a player character manifests a powerful mark and catches the attention of the Twelve, they may find themselves targeted for removal once again.

note(
## Building a spell list
While Aberrant marks are chaotic and destructive, they tend to follow a theme. Some ideas of potential themes are Acid, Plagues, Curses, Fire, Ice, Mental Assaults, or Blood Bending. When building your Corrupted Replication, you should pick spells that follow a general format - even if it might be suboptimal. Part of the balance of dragonmarks is that they don't always provide the strongest effect that they can at their level.

When building the Heightened Level list, spells should be placed at the heightened level one higher than their base spell level ie. Acid Storm, a 5th level spell should be placed at Heightened Level 6. Only rarely should the spell be placed at its actual level. You get one spell per level. Start with spells from the following list.

**Heightened Level** | **Spell**
--- | :---
2 | Acidic Burst, Agitate, Burning hands, Charm, Chilling Spray, Fear, Grease, Grim Tendrils, Noxious Vapors, Phantom Pain

# Dragonmark Focus Items ((Dragonmark Focus Items))
)
## Dragonmark focus items
Much of the influence of the dragonmarked houses is based on a simple principle: it’s easier to amplify an existing magical effect, such as that of a dragonmark, than to create the same effect from nothing. Taken on their own, the powers granted by dragonmarks aren’t overwhelmingly powerful. However, over the course of centuries, House Cannith and the Twelve have developed items that focus and enhance the powers of the mark to produce powerful, reliable effects. In many cases—such as the storm spires of House Lyrandar and the creation forges of House Cannith—the Arcane Congress has been unable to duplicate the effects of these powerful focus items for non-dragonmarked creatures. Other items have since been reproduced in forms that anyone can use, but an item that requires the user to possess a specific dragonmark is always easier to create and less expensive than one that produces the same effect for anyone, giving the dragonmarked houses an important advantage.

Dragonmark focus items are rarely sold in stores. They can only be created using proprietary tools, and are produced exclusively by House Cannith and the Twelve for use by trusted agents of the dragonmarked houses. So while many Medani inquisitives wear Medi spectacles, they acquired them through service to the house, not by purchasing them with gold. While a dragonmark focus item usually has the same general appearance as the item whose effects it duplicates, it bears the image of the required mark somewhere on the item and often carries the sigil of the associated house. Siberys dragonshards are a vital component of focus items, most including a shard in some form. With that said, a focus item’s design can differ from the usual magic item’s form—the serpentine mirror has a similar effect to a crystal ball, but it’s a flat mirror as opposed to an orb.

The following items are Dragonmark focus items. They function identically to the duplicated item, however, their level is reduced by 1. The price, but no other statistics are similarly reduced to the new level. All these items gain the Invested, and Dragonmark trait. You may only invest in the item if you have the requisite dragonmark.

The dragonmarked houses form the foundation of Khorvaire’s magical economy, and they’re the source of many of the magic items you can buy in the Five Nations. 90% of potions of healing are either made by House Jorasco or produced according to their specifications. If you have two +1 shortswords produced by a Cannith forge, they’ll be essentially identical, while an Aereni shortsword would be lovingly crafted by a particular artisan. In dealing with house products, consider whether the item is military or civilian. During the war, a large portion of House Cannith’s manufactured goods were designed for military use. If you buy a cloak of protection from a Cannith dealer in Sharn, is it an elegant model made for a noble to wear to the Tain Gala, or is it a Brelish Bear cloak, originally issued to an elite commando? If an item is essentially a tool of war, then it may have actually been used in the war; if so, which nation was it made for? Is it legitimate surplus? Was it likely sold by a retired soldier, or salvaged from a battlefield? Military gear is often more functional than decorative. It may bear the markings of a particular nation, and it may show signs of use. On the other hand, civilian products need to lure in customers. Consider a potion of healing. The potions Jorasco sold to the Brelish army were known as “coppers” because of the coppery taste of the fluid, and the potency is marked for accurate administration; a Brelish soldier might call a superior potion of healing a “copper-3.” By contrast, a civilian potion of healing could be called something like “Vivacity,” with a shiny label and available in a variety of flavours. You might find a barker in a part of town where the people are wealthy enough to buy such a product. “Feeling worn down? Perhaps you’ve had a little fall? Get back on your feet with a shot of Vivacity!”
